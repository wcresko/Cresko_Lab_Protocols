## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This procedure describes how to clean and sterilize pestles used for tissue homogenization.
-   **Procedure Type**: General Lab Maintenance
-   **Author**: Cresko Lab
-   **Date Created**: 2024

## Materials

-   Large beaker (or similar vessel for soaking pestles)
-   Aluminum foil
-   Autoclave tape
-   Autoclave (PAC 306D)
-   Nitrile gloves
-   Lab coat
-   Safety glasses

## Solutions

-   10% bleach solution (diluted from stock bleach)
-   Tap water
-   DI water (deionized water)

## Safety Precautions

::: {.callout-warning title="Warning - Chemical and Heat Hazards"}
**Bleach Safety**:
- Wear nitrile gloves, lab coat, and safety glasses when working with bleach solutions
- Work in a well-ventilated area
- Never mix bleach with acids or ammonia-containing products

**Autoclave Safety**:
- Items removed from autoclave will be extremely hot
- Allow items to cool completely before handling
- Use heat-resistant gloves if items must be moved while warm
- Follow autoclave operating procedures

See @sec-general-lab_safety for complete laboratory safety guidelines.

## Procedure

1.  Put on appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, safety glasses).

2.  Rinse dirty pestles thoroughly with tap water to remove tissue debris and residue.

3.  Place pestles into a large beaker and fill the beaker with 10% bleach solution, ensuring all pestles are submerged.

4.  Let the pestles sit for 10 minutes to decontaminate.

5.  Drain the bleach solution and rinse the pestles thoroughly with DI water to remove all bleach residue.

6.  Section the pestles into bunches of 5-10 pestles each.

7.  Wrap each bunch securely in aluminum foil.

8.  Use autoclave tape to seal the foil packages. Write the date on the autoclave tape.

9.  Transport wrapped pestles to the autoclave in room PAC 306D.

10. Autoclave foil-wrapped pestles using the 25-minute Gravity program.

    ::: {.callout-important title="Important"}
    Allow pestles to cool completely in the autoclave before removing. Hot items can cause burns.
    :::

11. Once cooled, store autoclaved pestles in a clean, dry location until needed.

## Waste Disposal

-   Dispose of bleach solution down the sink with running water
-   Recycle used aluminum foil if not contaminated, otherwise dispose in regular trash
