# Disposing of Hazardous Waste {#sec-general-hazard_waste}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This procedure provides a guideline of how to store and get rid of various forms of hazardous waste (HW) that are produced in the Cresko Lab.
-   **Procedure Type**: General Lab
-   **Author**: Mark Currey
-   **Date Created**: July 30, 2022

## Materials

-   Appropriate waste containers (carboys, bottles, buckets, or EHS-provided containers)
-   Chemical-resistant labels
-   Permanent marker
-   Nitrile gloves (minimum requirement)
-   Lab coat
-   Safety glasses
-   Secondary containment if needed

## Common Hazardous Waste Types

-   Paraformaldehyde (PFA)
-   Alcohols (ethanol, methanol, isopropanol)
-   Organic solvents (phenol, chloroform, formamide)
-   Trizol and other nucleic acid extraction reagents
-   Kit waste containing hazardous components
-   Contaminated solid waste (tips, tubes)

## Safety Precautions

::: {.callout-warning title="Warning - Hazardous Materials"}
**General Safety**:
- Always wear appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, safety glasses)
- Work in a fume hood when handling volatile or toxic chemicals
- Never mix incompatible chemicals (e.g., acids with bases, bleach with acids)
- Consult Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for specific chemical hazards
- Know the location of safety showers, eyewash stations, and spill kits

See @sec-general-lab_safety for complete laboratory safety guidelines.

## Procedure

::: {.callout-important title="Important - Labeling Requirements"}
**ALL CONTAINERS USED TO HOUSE HAZARDOUS WASTE MUST BE LABELED WITH:**
- Contents (specific chemical names, not abbreviations)
- Date waste collection started
- Owner/Principal Investigator name

Failure to properly label waste may result in non-compliance with EHS regulations.
:::

### 1. Common Hazardous Waste Streams

**Materials**: Paraformaldehyde (PFA), alcohols (ethanol, methanol, isopropanol), and common kit waste.

**Collection Procedure**:

a.  Collect these waste streams separately in appropriately labeled containers

    ::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
    Do not mix different chemical waste streams. Each type of waste should be collected separately.
    :::

b.  Small containers can be used for local collection on lab benches

c.  Transfer contents to the designated large carboy for consolidated storage

d.  Ensure the carboy is properly labeled with all required information

**Pickup Schedule**:

-   Every two weeks, a lab assistant will assess if waste containers need pickup
-   If pickup is needed, the lab assistant will initiate a waste pickup request through EHS
-   Submit requests at: https://safety.uoregon.edu/hazardous-materials
-   EHS contact for waste disposal: 6-3192

### 2. Exotic or Highly Hazardous Waste

**Materials**: Trizol, phenol, chloroform, formamide, and other highly toxic or corrosive materials.

::: {.callout-danger title="Danger - Highly Toxic Materials"}
These materials pose significant health risks. Always handle in a fume hood with appropriate PPE.
:::

**Collection Procedure**:

a.  **Before beginning work**: Communicate with the lab assistant about:
    -   Storage location for waste (typically in fume hood)
    -   Expected volume of waste
    -   Duration of waste collection period
    -   Specific hazards of materials being used

b.  **During work**: Collect waste in the designated location
    -   Solid waste (tips, tubes) contaminated with these materials must be collected separately
    -   Liquid waste should be collected in appropriate, chemically-resistant containers
    -   Keep containers in the fume hood to contain vapors

c.  **Container requirements**:
    -   Use secondary containment for liquid waste
    -   Ensure containers are compatible with waste chemicals
    -   Keep containers closed when not actively adding waste

**Pickup Schedule**:

-   Request pickup within two weeks of starting waste collection OR immediately upon completion of experiments, whichever comes first
-   Do not allow highly hazardous waste to accumulate for extended periods
-   Submit waste pickup requests at: https://safety.uoregon.edu/hazardous-materials

### 3. Special Waste Categories

::: {.callout-tip title="Tip"}
If you are unsure whether a material is hazardous waste or how to dispose of it, contact EHS at 6-3192 or consult with the lab manager.
