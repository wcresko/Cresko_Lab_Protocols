# Bacterial Waste Cleaning and Disposal {#sec-general-bact_waste}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This procedure describes how to clean and dispose of bacterial waste (E. coli and other recombinant materials).

-   **Procedure Type**: General Lab Maintenance

-   **Species**: E. coli and recombinant bacterial cultures

-   **Author**: Mark Currey

-   **Date Created**: March 8, 2024

-   **Date Updated**: 2024

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
This protocol is specifically for bacterial culture waste. For other types of hazardous waste disposal, see @sec-general-hazard_waste.
:::

## Materials

-   Bacterial waste tubes/flasks
-   Large carboy labeled 'Bacterial Waste' (located next to North side sink)
-   Graduated cylinder or measuring device (for bleach)
-   Nitrile gloves
-   Lab coat
-   Safety glasses

## Solutions

-   30% Bleach solution (diluted from stock bleach)
-   DI water (for rinsing)

## Safety Precautions

::: {.callout-warning title="Warning - Biohazard and Chemical Hazard"}
**Biological Safety**:
- Bacterial cultures and recombinant materials must be properly decontaminated before disposal
- Treat all bacterial waste as potentially hazardous
- Never pour untreated bacterial waste down the drain

**Bleach Safety**:
- Wear nitrile gloves, lab coat, and safety glasses when working with bleach solutions
- Work in a well-ventilated area
- 30% bleach is a concentrated solution - handle with care
- Rinse skin immediately if contact occurs

See @sec-general-lab_safety for complete laboratory safety guidelines.

## Procedure

### Decontaminating Bacterial Waste

1.  Put on appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, safety glasses).

2.  Pour approximately 10-15 mL of 30% bleach solution into each tube containing bacterial waste.

    ::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
    More bleach solution is acceptable if there is a large amount of bacterial waste. Ensure sufficient bleach to effectively decontaminate all material.
    :::

3.  Let the bleach solution sit for 3-5 hours, or until the solution becomes clear again.

    ::: {.callout-tip title="Tip"}
    The solution becoming clear indicates that the bleach has effectively killed the bacteria. Turbid solutions indicate live bacteria.
    :::

4.  Once the solution is clear, pour the bleach and decontaminated bacterial waste into the large carboy labeled 'Bacterial Waste' next to the North side sink.

5.  Rinse the empty tubes thoroughly with DI water.

6.  Place cleaned tubes on the shelving units below the kitchen water bath to dry.

### Managing the Bacterial Waste Carboy

::: {.callout-important title="Important"}
When the bacterial waste carboy becomes full or every two weeks (whichever comes first):
- Contact the lab assistant to arrange for proper disposal
- Do not overfill the carboy (leave at least 2 inches of headspace)
- Ensure the carboy is properly labeled with contents and date
:::

1.  Monitor the fill level of the bacterial waste carboy regularly.

2.  When the carboy is approximately 80% full, notify the lab assistant.

3.  The lab assistant will coordinate with EHS for proper disposal of the bacterial waste carboy.

4.  For questions about bacterial waste disposal, contact EHS at 6-3192 or see @sec-general-hazard_waste.
