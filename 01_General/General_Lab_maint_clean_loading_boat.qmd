::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
Loading boats are used to hold DNA samples before loading into agarose gels. Regular cleaning and sterilization prevent cross-contamination between samples.

## Materials

-   Used loading boats (approximately 2 in x 5 in)
-   Aluminum foil
-   Autoclave tape
-   Autoclave (PAC 306D)
-   Nitrile gloves (if using bleach solution)

## Solutions

-   Tap water
-   DI water (deionized water)
-   10% bleach solution (optional, for heavily contaminated boats)

## Safety Precautions

::: {.callout-warning title="Warning - Heat Hazard"}
**Autoclave Safety**:
- Items removed from autoclave will be extremely hot
- Allow items to cool completely before handling
- Use heat-resistant gloves if items must be moved while warm
- Follow autoclave operating procedures

If using bleach solution for heavily soiled boats:
- Wear nitrile gloves
- Work in a well-ventilated area
- See @sec-general-lab_safety for bleach safety guidelines

## Procedure

### Cleaning Loading Boats

1.  Rinse dirty loading boats thoroughly with tap water to remove gel debris and sample residue.

2.  Rinse again with DI water for a final rinse.

    ::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
    If loading boats are extremely dirty or contaminated, rinse them in a 10% bleach solution for 10 minutes before rinsing with tap water and DI water. Wear gloves when handling bleach.
    :::

3.  Allow loading boats to air dry completely on a clean surface or paper towel.

### Sterilizing Loading Boats

4.  Once dry, cover each large loading boat (approximately 2 in x 5 in) completely with aluminum foil.

5.  Use autoclave tape to secure the foil to the loading boat, ensuring a tight seal.

    ::: {.callout-tip title="Tip"}
    Write the date on the autoclave tape for tracking when items were sterilized.
    :::

6.  Transport wrapped loading boats to the autoclave in room PAC 306D.

7.  Autoclave foil-wrapped loading boats using the 25-minute Gravity program.

    ::: {.callout-important title="Important"}
    Allow loading boats to cool completely in the autoclave before removing. Hot items can cause burns.
    :::

8.  Once cooled, store autoclaved loading boats in a clean, dry location until needed.

## Waste Disposal

-   Dispose of heavily contaminated loading boats that cannot be cleaned in regular trash
-   Recycle aluminum foil if not contaminated
-   If bleach was used, dispose of solution down the sink with running water
