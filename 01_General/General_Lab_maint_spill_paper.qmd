# Changing Spill Paper {#sec-general-spill_paper}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This procedure describes how to change spill paper (bench covers) in common laboratory areas.

-   **Procedure Type**: General Lab Maintenance

-   **Species**: N/A

-   **Author**: Mark Currey

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
Spill paper (also called bench paper or absorbent bench covers) protects work surfaces from chemical spills and contamination. Regular replacement maintains a clean and safe working environment.
:::

## Materials

-   Roll of spill paper (absorbent bench covers)
-   Tape (lab tape or masking tape)
-   Scissors
-   Nitrile gloves
-   Paper towels or cleaning cloths
-   Spray bottle with 70% ethanol or appropriate cleaning solution

## Solutions

-   70% ethanol (for cleaning surfaces)
-   DI water (if needed for cleaning)
-   10% bleach solution (for contaminated surfaces, if needed)

## Safety Precautions

::: {.callout-warning title="Warning - Contamination Hazard"}
**When handling used spill paper**:
- Assume all used spill paper may be contaminated with chemicals or biological materials
- Always wear nitrile gloves when removing old spill paper
- If spill paper is visibly contaminated with hazardous materials, dispose of it according to @sec-general-hazard_waste procedures
- Wash hands thoroughly after completing the procedure

See @sec-general-lab_safety for complete laboratory safety guidelines.

## Procedure

### Removing Old Spill Paper

1.  Put on nitrile gloves before handling used spill paper.

2.  Carefully remove old spill paper from the work surface.

    ::: {.callout-important title="Important"}
    Check the condition of the spill paper:
    - **Not contaminated**: Place in regular trash
    - **Contaminated with hazardous materials**: Dispose in solid waste or follow @sec-general-hazard_waste procedures
    - **Contaminated with biological materials**: Treat as biohazard waste
    :::

3.  Inspect the surface where the spill paper was located for any remaining residue or contamination.

### Cleaning the Surface

4.  If there is any residue or visible contamination on the surface:

    a. Spray the surface with 70% ethanol (or 10% bleach if biologically contaminated)

    b. Wipe the surface thoroughly with paper towels or a cleaning cloth

    c. Allow the surface to air dry

    d. Dispose of contaminated cleaning materials appropriately

5.  Ensure the surface is clean and dry before applying new spill paper.

### Installing New Spill Paper

6.  Measure the work surface to determine the appropriate size of spill paper needed.

7.  Cut out the appropriate-sized piece of spill paper using scissors.

    ::: {.callout-tip title="Tip"}
    Cut the spill paper slightly smaller than the work surface to prevent edges from curling up.
    :::

8.  Place the spill paper flat on the clean, dry surface with the **plastic-coated side facing down** and the absorbent paper side facing up.

    ::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
    The plastic side protects the bench surface from spills, while the absorbent paper side faces up to catch any drips or spills.
    :::

9.  Tape the edges of the spill paper to the work surface, ensuring the paper lies flat without wrinkles or bubbles.

10. Smooth out any wrinkles or air pockets to create a flat working surface.

## Maintenance Schedule

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
**Recommended replacement schedule**:
- Replace spill paper weekly in high-use areas
- Replace immediately if visibly contaminated or damaged
- Replace after any significant spill
:::

## Waste Disposal

-   **Uncontaminated spill paper**: Regular trash
-   **Chemically contaminated spill paper**: See @sec-general-hazard_waste
-   **Biologically contaminated spill paper**: Autoclave or dispose as biohazard waste
-   **Cleaning materials**: Dispose according to contamination level
