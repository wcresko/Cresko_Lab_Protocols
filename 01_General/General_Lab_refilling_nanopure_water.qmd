# Refilling Nanopure Water {#sec-general-npH2O}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This procedure describes how to refill the 20L Nalgene carboy with nanopure water for laboratory use.
-   **Procedure Type**: General Lab Maintenance
-   **Author**: Micah Woods
-   **Date Created**: March 11, 2024

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
Nanopure water (ultrapure water) is required for many molecular biology procedures to prevent contamination. The lab maintains a 20L carboy for convenient access to this water.
:::

## Materials

-   20L Nalgene carboy (polycarbonate or HDPE)
-   Barnstead NANOpure Infinity ultrapure water system (located in PAC 314)
-   Cart or dolly for transporting heavy carboy (optional)

## Water Quality

-   Nanopure water specifications:
    -   Resistivity: 18.2 MΩ·cm at 25°C
    -   TOC (Total Organic Carbon): < 5 ppb
    -   Type I ultrapure water quality

## Safety Precautions

::: {.callout-warning title="Warning - Heavy Object"}
**Lifting Safety**:
- The 20L carboy when full weighs approximately 20 kg (44 lbs)
- Use proper lifting technique to avoid back injury
- Use a cart or dolly for transport if available
- Get assistance if needed - do not attempt to lift alone if uncomfortable
- Ensure the cap is tightly secured before moving to prevent spills

See @sec-general-lab_safety for complete laboratory safety guidelines.

## Procedure

### Transporting the Carboy

1.  Check if the 20L carboy is empty or nearly empty.

2.  If there is water remaining, empty it or use it before refilling.

3.  Transport the empty 20L carboy to room PAC 314 where the Barnstead NANOpure Infinity machine is located.

    ::: {.callout-tip title="Tip"}
    Use a cart or dolly for easier transport of the carboy.
    :::

### Operating the NANOpure Machine

4.  Position the carboy under the dispensing nozzle of the NANOpure Infinity machine.

5.  Remove the cap from the carboy.

6.  Turn the top dial on the NANOpure machine to "On."

7.  Press the "Standby" button to activate the system.

8.  Press the "Start/Stop" button to begin dispensing water.

    ::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
    Check the display to ensure water quality is within acceptable limits (resistivity should be 18.2 MΩ·cm). If not, contact lab staff before using the water.
    :::

9.  Monitor to ensure that water is flowing continuously into the carboy.

10. Wait approximately 20 minutes for the carboy to fill completely.

    ::: {.callout-important title="Important"}
    Do not leave the machine unattended for extended periods. Check periodically to prevent overflow.
    :::

### Shutting Down the Machine

11. When the carboy is full (filled to the shoulder, not to the very top), press the "Start/Stop" button to stop water flow.

12. Press the "Standby" button to return the system to standby mode.

13. Turn the top dial to "Off."

14. Replace the cap on the filled carboy and tighten securely.

### Returning to the Lab

15. Carefully transport the filled carboy back to the laboratory.

    ::: {.callout-warning title="Warning"}
    The filled carboy is heavy (approximately 20 kg). Use proper lifting technique and/or a cart.
    :::

16. Store the carboy in the designated location in the lab.

17. Label the carboy with the date filled if not already labeled.

## Troubleshooting

::: {.callout-tip title="Tip - Common Issues"}
**If water quality is poor** (resistivity below 18.2 MΩ·cm):
- Check if filters or purification cartridges need replacement
- Contact lab manager or EHS

**If machine does not dispense**:
- Check that machine is properly turned on
- Check water supply connection
- Contact lab manager if issue persists
:::

## Maintenance Notes

-   The NANOpure system is maintained by facility staff
-   Report any issues with water quality or machine function to the lab manager
-   Check water quality reading on display before filling
