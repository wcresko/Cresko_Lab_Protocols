# 2x Turbo {#sec-molecular-2x_Turbo}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This procedure describes how to create 2x Turbo PCR mix.
-   **Procedure Type**: Molecular
-   **Species**: N/A

::: {.callout-warning title="Safety"}
**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):**

- Lab coat
- Safety glasses
- Nitrile gloves

**Chemical Safety:**

- Handle Triton-X 100 with care; it is an irritant
- Handle DMSO with care; it can facilitate absorption of other chemicals through skin
- Work in a well-ventilated area when handling concentrated solutions

## Procedure:

1.  Mix above reagents together in order listed
2.  Mix thoroughly to ensure complete homogenization
3.  Aliquot into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes
4.  Label tubes with contents, date, and initials
5.  Store at -20°C

::: {.callout-note title="Quality Control"}
- Verify pH and concentration of stock solutions before mixing
- Test new batch with a positive control PCR reaction
- Date and track batch numbers for quality assurance
