# Paraformaldehyde {#sec-molecular-paraformaldehyde}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This procedure describes how to make 8% paraformaldehyde. This protocol is the one I have used and makes use of pH to get the PFA into solution relatively quickly - then you readjust the pH. It's for 8% - then you can add 1:1 2x PBS.
-   **Procedure Type**: Molecular
-   **Species**: N/A

::: {.callout-warning title="Safety"}
**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):**

- Lab coat
- Safety glasses or face shield
- Chemical-resistant gloves (nitrile)
- Work in a fume hood (REQUIRED)

**Chemical Safety:**

- **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT**: Paraformaldehyde is toxic, potentially carcinogenic, and produces irritating fumes
- ALWAYS prepare paraformaldehyde solutions in a fume hood
- Avoid inhalation, skin contact, and eye contact
- NaOH is caustic; handle with extreme care
- HCl is corrosive; use appropriate precautions
- Never heat above 60°C; overheating can degrade the solution

**Disposal:**

- Dispose of paraformaldehyde waste according to institutional chemical waste protocols
- Do not pour down the drain

## Procedure

::: {.callout-danger title="Human Health Warning"}
Paraformaldehyde can be hazardous to your health - make sure you prepare in the fume hood.
:::

-   Add 40 g Paraformaldehyde to 450 ml distilled water (or scale for desired final volume).

-   Add 1 ul of 10 N NaOH per ml of water (i.e. 500 ul for 500 ml).

-   Apply medium heat while stirring at medium speed to dissolve - approx 15-20 min.

-   Solution should not go above 60º C.

-   Eventually, granules will fully dissolve and the solution will become translucent.

::: {.callout-important title="Important"}
**DO NOT LET THE SOLUTION STIR BEYOND THIS POINT** - It will form a fuzzy precipitate that reduces the solution strength after filtering.
:::

-   Once the granules have dissolved and the solution clears, turn off the heat and equilibrate to pH 7.4 with approx 1.5 ml of 20% HCl (or scale, depending on target volume).

-   Bring volume to 500 ml (or scaled volume) with distilled water.

-   Filter while still warm to 0.45 um (or 0.2 um). Aliquot and store at -20º C.
