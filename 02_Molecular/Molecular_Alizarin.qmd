# Alizarin Staining {#sec-molecular_alizarin}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: Alizarin staining of fixed adult fish.
-   **Procedure Type**: Molecular
-   **Species**:
    -   Threespine stickleback, *Gasterosteus aculeatus*
    -   Gulf pipefish (*Syngnathus scovelli*)
    -   and others
-   **Author**: Unknown

::: {.callout-warning title="Safety"}
**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):**

- Lab coat
- Safety glasses
- Chemical-resistant gloves (nitrile or latex)

**Chemical Safety:**

- Alizarin red S is a dye; avoid skin and eye contact
- KOH is caustic; handle with extreme care
- Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizer; handle carefully
- Paraformaldehyde is toxic; see @sec-molecular-paraformaldehyde for PFA safety
- Isopropanol is flammable; keep away from open flames
- Work in a well-ventilated area or fume hood

**Biological Safety:**

- Use euthanasia protocols approved by your IACUC
- Handle fixed specimens with care
:::

## Materials:

-   Alizarin red S
-   KOH
-   6% or 30% H~2~O~2~
-   NaOH
-   containers for solutions
-   shaker

## Solutions:

-   **0.5% Alizarin red S Stock**:
    -   To make 50 mls add 0.25g alizarin red S powder to 50 ml water.
-   **0.025% Alizarin Stain**
    -   To make 100 mls: Add 500µl 0.5% alizarin red S (stock) to 99.5ml 1% KOH
    -   1 Liter: Add 5ml 0.5% alizarin red S (stock) to 9950ml (1 liter) 1%KOH
-   **3% H202/0.5%KOH**: Mix and keep at 4C; Before using, bring to room temperature to hold down introducing bubbles under the skin: 0.5ml 6%H202 & 0.5ml 1%KOH.
-   Euthanasia strength MS-222 (see husbandry protocols for euthanasia)
-   8% PFA (see @sec-molecular-paraformaldehyde)
-   **2X PBS**
    -   1.6% NaCl
    -   0.04% KCl
    -   0.04 M PO4 pH 7.0- 7.3
-   **Isopropanol**

Please use appropriate PPE when handling chemicals.

## Procedure:

1.  Fix in 4% PFA 2h to overnight depending on the size of the fish.

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
We've found that adult fish should be fixed overnight.
:::

2.  Wash with 1% KoH 1 hour or longe on shaker.

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
If found that a longer KoH wash results in better staining.
:::

3.  Bleach with 3% H202 : 1% KoH solution for 1-4 hours until the eyes and skin lose most of the pigment.

::: {.callout-note title="Warning"}
This step produces a gas. Do not put lids on containers while bleaching.
:::

4.  Wash with 1% KoH 2 hour on shaker.

5.  Stain with 0.025% Alizarin Red solution for 2 h or longer.

::: {.callout-note title="Note"} Check for the strenght of staining often. I prefer to slightly over stain as slight non-specific (muscles and etc) will clear in the following steps. ::

6.  Wash with 1% KoH 2 hour or longer on shaker depending on clearing of non-specific tissues.

7.  Store in 50% Isopropanol.
