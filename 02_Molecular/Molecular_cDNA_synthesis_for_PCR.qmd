**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):**

- Lab coat

**Chemical Safety:**

- Handle DTT with care; it is an irritant and has a strong odor
- Work in a well-ventilated area
- RNase-free technique required; wear gloves at all times

## Materials

-   Thermal cycler or heat block
-   Ice
-   Microcentrifuge tubes (RNase-free)
-   Pipettes and RNase-free tips

## Solutions

-   2 µl Oligo d(T)23 VN (50 µM, NEB; anchored-dT primer)
-   X µl up to 5 µg total RNA
-   1 µl 10 mM dNTP mix
-   Nuclease-free water
-   2 µl 10x RT buffer (Invitrogen)
-   4 µl 25 mM MgCl2
-   2 µl 0.1 M DTT (Invitrogen)
-   1 µl RNase inhibitor, e.g., RNAseOUT (Invitrogen)
-   1 µl Superscript III reverse transcriptase (200 u/µl, Invitrogen)

## Procedure

1.  **First strand synthesis**

    1.  Combine:

        1.  2 µl Oligo d(T)23 VN (50 µM, NEB; anchored-dT primer)\*
        2.  X µl up to 5 µg total RNA
        3.  1 µl 10 mM dNTP mix
        4.  Water (if necessary) to bring total to 10 µl

        ::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
        Recommend using Oligo d(T)23 VN if starting with total RNA to bias cDNA to messenger RNA. Random Primer Mix will do a better job of covering 5' ends if starting with mRNA. If the RNA is degraded or if very long sequences are required, may instead use 2 µl Random Primer Mix (60 µM, NEB; a mix of random hexamers, anchored-dT primers, and 1 mM dNTPs).

2.  Heat to 65°C for 5 min., then place on ice

3.  Collect contents at bottom of tube by brief centrifugation.

4.  Add:

    1.  2 µl 10x RT buffer (Invitrogen)
    2.  4 µl 25 mM MgCl2
    3.  2 µl 0.1 M DTT (Invitrogen)
    4.  1 µl RNase inhibitor, e.g., RNAseOUT (Invitrogen)
    5.  1 µl Superscript III reverse transcriptase (200 u/µl, Invitrogen)

    ::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
    Reaction can be scaled up to accommodate more starting RNA.
    :::

5.  Mix by gentle aspiration

6.  Incubate at 25°C for 5 min.

7.  **Synthesis**: Incubate at 50°C for 50 min.

8.  **Inactivation**: Heat to 85°C for 5 min. Chill on ice, collect contents to bottom by short spin.

9.  **Destroy RNA template**: Add 1 µl RNase H (2 u/µl), incubate at 37°C for 20 min.

10. Proceed to PCR (see @sec-molecular-Phusion_PCR). Depending on expression level, may be able to use a dilution of cDNA as template – try 1:50 dilution in EB, use 2 µl as template in a 20 µl reaction. Don't dilute your entire amount of cDNA, as some products may require a higher concentration of template.

::: {.callout-note title="Storage"}
cDNA can be stored at -20°C for several months or at -80°C for long-term storage.
