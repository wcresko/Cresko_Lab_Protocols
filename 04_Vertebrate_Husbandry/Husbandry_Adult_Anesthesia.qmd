# Adult Fish Anesthesia {#sec-husbandry-adult_anesthesia}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This protocol describes how to safely anesthetize adult fish for imaging, measurements, surgical procedures, or other manipulations
-   **Procedure Type**: Husbandry/Anesthesia
-   **Species**:
    -   Threespine stickleback (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*)
    -   Bay pipefish (*Syngnathus leptorhyncus*)
    -   Gulf pipefish (*Syngnathus scovelli*)
-   **Author**: Mark Currey
-   **Date Created**: February 28, 2024, updated November 22, 2025
-   **IACUC Protocol**: Required for all anesthesia procedures

::: {.callout-important title="Safety and Handling"}
-   Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, safety glasses)
-   MS-222 (tricaine) can be absorbed through skin - always wear gloves
-   Work in well-ventilated area
-   Never consume food or drink in anesthesia work area
-   Dispose of MS-222 solutions according to chemical waste protocols
-   Keep MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) readily accessible
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="IACUC Compliance"}
All anesthesia procedures must be:

-   Covered by current IACUC protocol
-   Performed by trained personnel
-   Documented in laboratory records
-   Monitored for fish welfare
-   Ended with appropriate recovery or euthanasia

**Anesthesia is not euthanasia:** Fish must either fully recover or be properly euthanized. Prolonged anesthesia without recovery or euthanasia is not acceptable.
:::

## Background

MS-222 (tricaine methanesulfonate, also called tricaine or ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate) is the most commonly used anesthetic for fish. It is FDA-approved for use in fish and acts as a central nervous system depressant, inducing a dose-dependent sedation and anesthesia.

### Mechanism of Action

MS-222 works by blocking sodium channels in nerve cell membranes, similar to local anesthetics like lidocaine. At appropriate concentrations, it produces:

-   Light sedation (reduced activity, maintained equilibrium)
-   Deep sedation (loss of equilibrium, reduced opercular rate)
-   Surgical anesthesia (no response to stimuli, slow opercular rate)
-   Overdose/death (cessation of opercular movements)

The goal for most procedures is to achieve deep sedation or light surgical anesthesia - enough to immobilize the fish for manipulation but maintaining respiratory movements.

### Factors Affecting Anesthesia

-   **Water temperature:** Warmer water increases metabolic rate and speeds induction
-   **Fish size:** Smaller fish require less time to anesthetize
-   **Fish health:** Stressed or sick fish are more sensitive
-   **Water chemistry:** pH, salinity, oxygen levels all affect uptake
-   **Individual variation:** Always monitor each fish individually

## Materials

### Equipment
-   Small containers or petri dishes (for anesthesia)
-   Larger containers or tanks (for recovery)
-   Transfer pipettes or small nets
-   Timer or clock
-   Thermometer
-   pH meter or pH strips
-   Imaging equipment or other experimental apparatus (as needed)

### Optional
-   Dissecting microscope (for detailed observation)
-   Small sponge or soft surface (for positioning during imaging)
-   Gloves (nitrile or latex)

## Solutions

### MS-222 Stock Solution (4g/L)

::: {.callout-note title="Pharmaceutical Grade Tricaine"}
**CRITICAL:** Tricaine must be pharmaceutical-grade. We use tricaine purchased from Pentair (manufactured by Western Chemical, FDA approved). Tricaine (3-amino benzoic acid ethyl ester, also called ethyl m-aminobenzoate) comes in powdered form. Purchase the smallest amount possible because tricaine expires quickly (typically 1-2 years from manufacture date).

-   Check expiration date before use
-   Store powder at 4°C in original container
-   Protect from light and moisture
-   Discard if discolored or clumped
:::

**Tris-Buffered MS-222 Stock (4g/L)**

```
-   4 g tricaine powder
-   979 ml deionized (DD) water
-   ~21 ml 1 M Tris (pH 9)
-   Adjust pH to ~7.0
-   Aliquot in 50ml tubes
-   Label with "MS-222 Stock Solution 4g/L" and date
-   Store at -20°C
-   This makes 1 liter of stock solution
-   Stable for 6 months when frozen
```

::: {.callout-tip title="Why Buffer MS-222?"}
Unbuffered MS-222 is very acidic (pH ~3), which is stressful to fish and less effective as an anesthetic. Buffering to neutral pH (7.0-7.5) with Tris improves efficacy and reduces stress. Always check pH before use.
:::

### Anesthesia Working Solution

The standard anesthesia concentration for adult fish is **168 mg/L** (also written as 0.168 g/L or 168 ppm).

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Stickleback

**For 100 ml working solution:**

-   92.5 ml of 3 ppt Instant Ocean solution
-   7.5 ml of MS-222 stock (4g/L)
-   Final concentration: 168 mg/L in 3 ppt salinity

**Prepare 3 ppt Instant Ocean:**

-   0.3 g Instant Ocean salt mix
-   100 ml deionized water
-   Mix until fully dissolved

**Storage:**

-   Store in amber (dark) bottle to protect from light
-   Label with: "MS-222 Anesthesia 168 mg/L", preparation date, expiration date (6 months)
-   Keep at room temperature or 4°C
-   Discard if discolored, precipitated, or past expiration

#### Pipefish/Syngnathid

**For 100 ml working solution:**

-   92.5 ml of 25-30 ppt Instant Ocean solution
-   7.5 ml of MS-222 stock (4g/L)
-   Final concentration: 168 mg/L in 25-30 ppt salinity

**Prepare 25-30 ppt Instant Ocean:**

-   2.5-3.0 g Instant Ocean salt mix
-   100 ml deionized water
-   Mix until fully dissolved

**Notes for Syngnathids:**

-   Use full-strength seawater (25-30 ppt) to match their osmotic requirements
-   Bay pipefish are more sensitive - may need lower concentration (start with 120-140 mg/L)
-   Gulf pipefish tolerate wider salinity range but prefer 25-30 ppt

**Storage:**

-   Store in amber bottle to protect from light
-   Label with: "MS-222 Anesthesia 168 mg/L", preparation date, expiration date (6 months)
-   Keep at room temperature or 4°C

:::

### Recovery Water

Prepare fresh water appropriate for your species:

-   **Stickleback:** 3 ppt Instant Ocean or system water
-   **Pipefish:** 25-30 ppt Instant Ocean or system water
-   Use same temperature as holding system
-   Ensure adequate oxygenation (aeration or frequent water changes)

## Procedure

### Pre-Anesthesia Preparation

::: {.callout-tip title="Planning Ahead"}
-   Know exactly what procedure you will perform and estimate duration
-   Have all equipment ready before anesthetizing fish
-   Work quickly but carefully - minimize anesthesia time
-   Target total anesthesia time: <10 minutes for routine procedures
-   Plan recovery container and monitoring schedule
:::

1.  **Prepare workspace**

    -   Set up anesthesia container (petri dish or small container)
    -   Set up recovery container with fresh, aerated water
    -   Prepare imaging or experimental equipment
    -   Ensure adequate lighting
    -   Have timer ready

2.  **Prepare solutions**

    -   Pour ~50-100 ml MS-222 anesthesia solution into anesthesia container
    -   Fill recovery container with fresh water (200-500 ml, depending on fish size)
    -   Verify temperature is appropriate (16-20°C for stickleback, 18-22°C for pipefish)
    -   Optional: Check pH of anesthesia solution (should be 7.0-7.5)

3.  **Select and observe fish**

    -   Choose healthy fish only - do not anesthetize sick or stressed fish
    -   Observe for 5 minutes: normal swimming, feeding, coloration
    -   Record fish ID or description
    -   Note start time

### Anesthesia Induction

4.  **Transfer fish to anesthesia solution**

    -   Use transfer pipette or small net
    -   Minimize air exposure
    -   Gently place fish in anesthesia container
    -   Start timer immediately

5.  **Monitor anesthesia stages**

    ::: {.callout-note title="Stages of Anesthesia"}
    **Stage 1: Light Sedation (0-2 minutes)**

    -   Decreased swimming activity
    -   Decreased response to external stimuli
    -   Normal opercular rate
    -   Normal equilibrium

    **Stage 2: Deep Sedation (2-4 minutes)**

    -   Increased loss of muscle tone
    -   Erratic swimming
    -   Decreased opercular rate
    -   Loss of equilibrium (fish tips on side or inverts)

    **Stage 3: Surgical Anesthesia (4-6 minutes)**

    -   Total loss of muscle tone
    -   No response to handling
    -   Slow, regular opercular movements
    -   No reflex response to tail pinch

    **Stage 4: Overdose**

    -   Opercular movements very slow or stopped
    -   Cardiac arrest (if prolonged)
    -   **AVOID THIS STAGE** unless euthanizing
    :::

6.  **Achieve appropriate anesthesia depth**

    -   For imaging or measurements: Stage 2 (loss of equilibrium) is usually sufficient
    -   For surgery or manipulations: Stage 3 (surgical anesthesia) required
    -   **Key indicator:** Fish should not respond to gentle handling but maintain slow opercular movements
    -   Typical induction time: 3-6 minutes for adults (faster for smaller fish)

### During Anesthesia

7.  **Perform procedure**

    -   Work quickly but carefully
    -   Keep fish moist if out of water
        -   Use transfer pipettes to drip anesthesia solution on gills
        -   Can place fish on damp sponge or soft surface
        -   Never let fish dry out
    -   Monitor opercular movements continuously
    -   Target procedure time: <5 minutes for routine work, <10 minutes maximum

::: {.callout-warning title="Monitoring During Anesthesia"}
**CRITICAL MONITORING:**

-   **Opercular (gill cover) movements must continue throughout procedure**
-   If opercular movements stop: immediately transfer to recovery water
-   If opercular movements become very slow (<10 per minute): prepare to end procedure
-   If fish appears too deeply anesthetized: transfer to recovery water immediately

**Normal opercular rates during anesthesia:**

-   Light sedation: 50-80% of normal rate
-   Deep sedation: 30-50% of normal rate
-   Surgical anesthesia: 20-40% of normal rate
-   **Danger zone:** <20% of normal rate
:::

8.  **Complete procedure**

    -   Finish procedure as quickly as possible
    -   Record any observations or measurements
    -   Take photos if needed
    -   Note total anesthesia time

### Recovery

9.  **Transfer to recovery water**

    -   Gently transfer fish using pipette or soft net
    -   Place in recovery container with fresh, aerated water
    -   Position fish upright if needed
    -   Note time of transfer to recovery

10. **Support recovery**

    -   If fish is deeply anesthetized, gently move through water to pass water over gills
    -   Hold fish upright with head facing into gentle current (if using airstone)
    -   Can use transfer pipette to gently direct water flow over gills
    -   Continue until fish shows signs of increased opercular rate

11. **Monitor recovery progression**

    ::: {.callout-note title="Stages of Recovery"}
    **Early Recovery (0-5 minutes):**

    -   Opercular rate increases
    -   May remain on side or inverted
    -   No swimming movements

    **Mid Recovery (5-10 minutes):**

    -   Opercular rate near normal
    -   Fish rights itself
    -   Weak swimming movements begin

    **Late Recovery (10-20 minutes):**

    -   Normal opercular rate
    -   Active swimming
    -   Maintains equilibrium
    -   May still have reduced response to external stimuli

    **Full Recovery (20+ minutes):**

    -   Normal swimming behavior
    -   Normal response to stimuli
    -   Normal coloration
    :::

12. **Check recovery every 2-5 minutes**

    -   Look for increasing opercular rate
    -   Watch for return of swimming ability
    -   Note return of equilibrium
    -   Check for normal coloration
    -   Typical recovery time: 5-20 minutes

::: {.callout-warning title="Recovery Problems"}
**If fish is not recovering:**

-   Ensure water is well-oxygenated (add airstone if not present)
-   Check water temperature (should match system temperature)
-   Gently move fish through water to increase gill perfusion
-   Continue support for up to 30 minutes
-   If no signs of recovery after 30 minutes, consult with supervisor

**Signs of successful recovery:**

-   Normal opercular rate
-   Active swimming
-   Attempts to evade handling
-   Normal coloration (not pale or dark)
:::

### Post-Recovery

13. **Return to system or continue monitoring**

    -   Once fully recovered (normal swimming, equilibrium, responsiveness), fish can be returned to home tank
    -   **Alternative:** Keep in recovery tank for additional monitoring (2-24 hours)
    -   Monitor during next daily health check
    -   Record successful recovery and any observations

14. **Documentation**

    -   Record in laboratory notebook or database:
        -   Fish ID
        -   Date and time
        -   Anesthesia concentration and duration
        -   Procedure performed
        -   Recovery time
        -   Any complications or observations
    -   Update IACUC records if required

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Slow or no induction | Anesthesia solution too dilute | Check concentration; make fresh solution |
| | Old or degraded MS-222 | Use fresh stock; check expiration date |
| | pH too low or high | Verify pH is 7.0-7.5; adjust if needed |
| | Water temperature too cold | Warm to appropriate temperature |
| Rapid, deep anesthesia | Concentration too high | Use lower concentration (120-140 mg/L) |
| | Fish too small for adult dose | Reduce concentration or volume |
| | Fish stressed or weakened | Select healthier fish; pre-screen carefully |
| Fish stops breathing | Over-anesthetization | Immediately transfer to recovery water; support gills |
| | Procedure too long | Work faster; plan procedure better |
| | Anesthesia too concentrated | Reduce concentration for next fish |
| Slow recovery | Excessive anesthesia depth | Reduce concentration or time for next fish |
| | Inadequate oxygenation | Add airstone; change water |
| | Fish exhausted or stressed | Provide extended recovery time; monitor closely |
| No recovery | Overdose | Ensure opercular monitoring during procedure |
| | Procedure too long | Limit anesthesia time to <10 minutes |
| | Underlying health issue | Pre-screen fish health carefully |
| Fish hyperactive after recovery | Insufficient anesthesia | Increase concentration slightly |
| | Stress response | Normal for some fish; monitor, usually resolves |
| Repeat anesthesia needed | First dose insufficient | Acceptable to re-anesthetize after full recovery |
| | | Allow at least 30 minutes between anesthesia events |

## Concentration Adjustments

### When to Use Lower Concentrations

-   Very small fish (<30 mm)
-   Fish in poor health or stressed
-   Prolonged procedures (>10 minutes)
-   Species known to be sensitive (e.g., bay pipefish)

**Suggested lower dose:** 120-140 mg/L

### When to Use Higher Concentrations

-   Very large fish (>60 mm)
-   Fish resistant to anesthesia
-   Quick procedures (<2 minutes)

**Suggested higher dose:** 200-250 mg/L

::: {.callout-warning}
Always start with standard concentration (168 mg/L) for new species or procedures. Adjust only after observing response. Never exceed 300 mg/L for routine anesthesia.
:::

## Special Considerations

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Stickleback

**Anesthesia Response:**
-   Generally robust and tolerate anesthesia well
-   Adult males in breeding condition may be more sensitive
-   Spines can make handling difficult - use soft nets or careful hand positioning

**Recovery:**
-   Usually quick and uneventful
-   Can be quite active immediately upon recovery - use covered containers to prevent jumping

**Typical Timings:**
-   Induction: 3-5 minutes
-   Recovery: 5-15 minutes

### Pipefish/Syngnathid

**Anesthesia Response:**
-   More delicate than stickleback - require careful monitoring
-   Bay pipefish (*S. leptorhyncus*) may be more sensitive than gulf pipefish
-   Body shape makes it difficult to assess equilibrium loss - watch for cessation of swimming

**Recovery:**
-   May be slower than stickleback (10-20 minutes)
-   Often settle to bottom during recovery - this is normal
-   Pregnant males: extra care to avoid embryo loss

**Typical Timings:**
-   Induction: 4-6 minutes (bay pipefish often faster)
-   Recovery: 10-20 minutes

**Special Notes:**
-   Use full-strength seawater (25-30 ppt)
-   Ensure water temperature matches system (18-22°C)
-   Can be more prone to jumping during light sedation - use covered containers

## Alternative Anesthetics

While MS-222 is the standard, other anesthetics are occasionally used:

### Clove Oil (Eugenol)

-   Natural anesthetic derived from clove plants
-   Less expensive than MS-222
-   Must be dissolved in ethanol first (1:10 clove oil:ethanol)
-   Working concentration: 40-100 mg/L
-   Not FDA approved for fish
-   Recovery can be longer than MS-222

### 2-Phenoxyethanol

-   Alternative to MS-222
-   Working concentration: 0.1-0.5 ml/L
-   Less commonly used
-   Not FDA approved

::: {.callout-note}
This protocol focuses on MS-222 as it is FDA-approved and most commonly used in research settings. Consult with supervisor and IACUC before using alternative anesthetics.
:::

## Quality Control

-   Test anesthesia solution with control fish before critical experiments
-   Keep log of induction and recovery times to track consistency
-   Make fresh working solutions every 6 months
-   Check pH of stock solutions periodically
-   Maintain accurate records for IACUC compliance
