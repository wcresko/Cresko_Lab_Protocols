## Procedure

### Complete Bleaching and Cleaning of Tank

This needs to be done to each tank every 2 months.

1.  Remove fish from tank and put them into a clean tank. Tanks that are emptied of fish need to be cleaned and sterilized before another batch of fish can be introduced.

2.  Drain the tank and remove it from the rack. Clean air diffuser as instructed below. Clean the tank and all parts thoroughly with a scrub pad, taking care not to damage the silicon water seals on the inside (algae should be left if very gentle rubbing will not remove it).

3.  Squirt about 10-20 mls of bleach into the tank. Wash the bleach water thoroughly around the inside of the tank by hand using a pad or sponge exposing all inside portions of the tank to bleach.

4.  Rinse the tank thoroughly with hot tap water. **Rinse the tank with sodium thiosulfate, and then rinse it again with hot water. Put a few thiosulfate crystals into the tank and leave it.**

5.  Reassemble the tank and put it back on the rack. Fill with system water and using a dry erase marker record date/time on the front of the tank.

6.  Allow water to recirculate for about **30 minutes** before adding fish. If adding fish, **Watch fish for 15 min** after adding them to look for any signs of distress.

7.  **Initial check list** upon completion.

### Air Diffuser Cleaning

1.  Remove dirty air diffusers from tanks and rinse with tap water to remove excess algae and debris.

2.  Place in 10% bleach solution for 15-30 minutes. Please see @sec-husbandry-plastic_glassware_cleaning for bleach and sodium thiosulfate instructions.

3.  Rinse with hot water for 5 minutes and then place into 3% sodium thiosulfate for 5 minutes.

4.  Rinse with hot water for 5 minutes.

5.  When cleaned air diffusers are placed back into aquaria, observe fish for 15 min for signs of distress.
