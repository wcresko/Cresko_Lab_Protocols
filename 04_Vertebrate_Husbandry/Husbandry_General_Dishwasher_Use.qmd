## Materials

-   Dishwasher soap (found under the sink)
-   Temperature tape (used weekly on Thursday)

## Solutions

-   None required

## Procedure

### Loading the Dishwasher

1.  **Put away clean dishes**: If there are clean dishes from a previous cycle, put them away in their respective locations. If some are still wet, set them out to dry on the drying rack before putting them away.

2.  **Rinse all dirty dishes very well**: Especially those with algae/food residue. The dishwasher will sanitize, but will not effectively clean, the dishes. Scrub dishes with a scrub pad to remove buildup, if needed.

3.  **Load small tank lids**: Small tank lids should be stacked on the bottom rack, but not on the raised portion of the rack, as this impedes the rinser from spinning properly.

4.  **Load plastic tanks and containers**: Plastic tanks and Ziploc containers should be placed on the top rack.

5.  **Load nets**: Nets can be placed on both racks.

6.  **Verify rinser can spin**: BEFORE RUNNING, slide both racks in and make sure the rinser on the bottom of the top rack can spin freely.

::: {.callout-warning title="Weekly Temperature Check"}
Once per week (ON THURSDAY) include temperature tape to verify dishwasher is reaching proper sanitization temperature.

### Running the Dishwasher

1.  **Add detergent**: Add ~1/2 scoop of dish detergent (found under the sink) to the well in the door of the dishwasher. Close the lid to the well.

2.  **Close and start**: Close and latch the door to the dishwasher. The display will light up, and after booting up it should read "User 1."

3.  **Navigate menu (if needed)**:
    -   If display shows "User 1": Press the RUN/CANCEL button to begin the cycle
    -   If it displays a list of programs: Use the down arrow key to navigate down the list to "User 1." When "User 1" is highlighted, press RUN/CANCEL
    -   If screen displays something other than "User 1": Press the DISPLAY button to show the list of programs, scroll down to "User 1," and press RUN/CANCEL

4.  **Cancel if needed**: Should the program ever need to be cancelled mid-cycle, pressing the RUN/CANCEL button once will result in the cycle canceling and the water draining.

### Cleaning Large Tank Lids

1.  **Small frontal lids**: The small frontal lids to the large glass tanks should be loaded into the dishwasher.

2.  **Large lids**: The large lids to the large glass tanks should be hosed off thoroughly with very hot water, and set on the rack to dry.
