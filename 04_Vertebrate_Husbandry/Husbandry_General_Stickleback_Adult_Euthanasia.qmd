# Stickleback Adult Euthanasia {#sec-husbandry_stickleback_adult_euthansisa}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This procedure describes best practices for euthanizing adult threespine stickleback.
-   **Procedure Type**: Husbandry
-   **Species**:
    -   Threespine stickleback, (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*)
-   **Author**: Mark Currey
-   **Date Created**: May 6, 2008; revised November 29, 2017 and 2023 by Mark Currey
-   **IACUC Protocol**: Required for all euthanasia procedures

::: {.callout-important title="IACUC Compliance"}
-   All euthanasia must be performed by trained personnel
-   Documented in laboratory records
-   Follow approved euthanasia protocols
-   Death must be confirmed before disposal or fixation
:::

::: {.callout-caution title="Chemical Safety"}
-   Tricaine (MS-222) can be absorbed through skin - always wear gloves
-   Work in well-ventilated area
-   Dispose of MS-222 solutions according to chemical waste protocols
-   Keep MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) readily accessible
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="Notes"}
Tricaine must be pharmaceutical-grade. We use tricaine purchased from Pentair, manufactured by Western Chemical and FDA approved. Tricaine (3-amino benzoic acid ethyl ester also called ethyl m-aminobenzoate) comes in a powdered form. Purchase the smallest amount possible because tricaine expires quickly.

## Materials

-   Euthanasia strength Mesab (see below)
-   Container to hold fish while being euthanized
-   Post mortem fixing equipment (if needed)
-   Morgue (freezer bag for disposal)
-   Gloves
-   Timer or clock

## Solutions

-   **Mesab Stock Solution (4g/L From Zebrafish Book 4th edition) (tris buffered)**:
    -   4 g tricaine powder
    -   979 ml DD water
    -   ~21 ml 1 M Tris (pH 9)
    -   Adjust pH to ~7
    -   Aliquot in 50ml tubes, label with MESAB Stock Solution 4g/L, and store in a -20 freezer
    -   This makes 1 liter of solution

-   **Euthanasia Solution (300 mg/L)**:
    -   Make a solution of tris buffered **Stock Solution** as described above (or obtain an aliquot from the freezer)
    -   Make a solution of 3.0 ppt Instant Ocean by adding 0.3 grams of Instant Ocean to 100 ml of DD water
    -   Combine 7.5ml of stock solution into 100 ml of 3 ppt Instant Ocean
    -   Store solution in an amber bottle to protect it from light and add mixed and expiration dates (6 months after being mixed) to the bottle

## Procedure

1.  **Immerse fish in euthanasia solution**: Place fish in Mesab euthanasia solution (300 mg/L) and wait 10 minutes.

2.  **Confirm death**:
    -   Ten minutes after opercular movement has stopped, perform a tap test by gently tapping on the table next to the container holding the fish
    -   If the fish is still alive this will trigger a startle response
    -   If fish responds, wait 5 more minutes and repeat tap test
    -   If no response after tap test, death is confirmed
    -   Proceed to fixing for post mortem experiments or place fish in the morgue
