## Procedure

1.  **Conduct health checks** of all fish in Winter Room and Summer Room according to @sec-husbandry-fish_health_check.

2.  **Prepare brine cone** for feeding by following the steps described in @sec-husbandry-brine_gen_hatch_feed.

3.  **Feed Stickleback twice per day**

    a.  **Winter Room**
        -   20g tanks: Feed 1 scoop of adult stickleback food per feeding.

    b.  **Summer Room**
        -   20g tanks: Feed 1 scoop of adult stickleback food per feeding.
        -   4.5 and 10.5 liter tanks:
            -   **Larval** (2.8L and 9.5L tanks): feed small squirt of brine shrimp.
            -   **Juvenile** (9.5L tanks): feed half of a scoop of juvenile food.

::: {.callout-warning title="Notes"}
Please pay attention to the fish size in the 9.5L tanks and feed accordingly. Tanks of similar sized fish will try to be clustered together on the racks for ease of feeding. Also pay attention to signs and/or tags and messages on the white board or Teams for direction on how 9.5L tanks are to be fed.

4.  **Feed Pipefish twice per day**

    a.  **Summer Room - 20g tanks (adults and juveniles)**

        -   **Adults**: feed frozen mysids
            -   During the morning feeding please feed the adults only frozen mysids
            -   In the evenings please feed frozen mysids and live brine shrimp (see @sec-husbandry-mysid_culture for mysid culture)
        -   **Juveniles**: feed squirt of brine shrimp

::: {.callout-note title="Preparing and Feeding Frozen Mysids"}
Partially fill the 1000 ml beaker labeled "Pipefish Only" located on the pipefish rack with pipefish water. Place a dime sized piece of frozen mysids (bottom shelf in freezer) in the beaker with water, and swirl water to thaw mysids. Once thawed, feed to the adult pipefish.
:::

    b.  **10.5 liter tanks (mysids, pregnant males, and juvenile pipefish)**

        -   **Juvenile pipefish/mysids**: feed small squirt of brine shrimp
