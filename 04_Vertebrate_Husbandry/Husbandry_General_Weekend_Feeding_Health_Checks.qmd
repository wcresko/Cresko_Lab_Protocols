## Procedure

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
Fish only need to be fed once per day on weekends. Ideally, fish will be fed on weekends around noon since they only receive one feeding, but this time can be flexible to accommodate weekend feeders' schedules.
:::

1.  **Conduct health checks** of all fish in Winter Room and Summer Room according to the steps described in @sec-husbandry-fish_health_check.

2.  Prepare brine cone for feeding by following the steps described in the brine shrimp hatching and feeding protocol.

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
Since fish are only fed once per day on weekends, use the entire brine cone to feed fish.
:::

3.  **Feed Stickleback**

    1.  Winter Room
        -   20g tanks
            1.  Feed 1 scoop of adult stickleback food.
    2.  Summer Room
        -   20g tanks
            1.  Feed 1 scoop of adult stickleback food.
        -   4.5 and 10.5 liter tanks
            1.  **Larval** (red tags): feed small squirt of brine shrimp.
            2.  **Juvenile** (green and blue tags): feed half of a scoop of juvenile food.

    ::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
    If there is not sufficient adult or juvenile food to conduct feedings, see the Stickleback Dry Food Mix protocol for instructions on making more food.
    :::

4.  Feed Pipefish

    1.  Summer Room

        -   20g tanks (adults and juveniles)

            1.  **Adults**: feed frozen mysids

            ::: {.callout-note title="Preparing and Feeding Frozen Mysids"}
            Partially fill the 1000 ml beaker labeled "Pipefish Only" located on the pipefish rack with pipefish water. Place a dime sized piece of frozen mysids (bottom shelf in freezer) in the beaker with water, and swirl water to thaw mysids. Once thawed, feed to the adult pipefish.
            :::

            2.  **Juveniles**: feed squirt of brine shrimp.

        -   10.5 liter tanks (mysids, pregnant males, and juvenile pipefish)

            1.  **Juvenile pipefish/mysids**: feed small squirt of brine shrimp.

::: {.callout-important title="Important"}
Please move any male that has given birth into a community (20g) adult pipefish tank
:::

5.  Reset brine shrimp cone according to steps described in the brine shrimp hatching and feeding protocol.

::: {.callout-note title="IACUC Protocol"}
This procedure is covered under the University of Oregon IACUC protocol for fish husbandry. Always follow approved protocols for animal welfare.
