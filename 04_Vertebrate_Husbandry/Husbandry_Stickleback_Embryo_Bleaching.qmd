# Embryo Bleaching for Disinfection {#sec-husbandry_stickleback_embryo_bleaching}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This protocol allows for the removal of ecto-parasites from embryos produced from wild-caught stickleback. Use this protocol whenever new fish are added to a pre-existing stickleback rearing system, or whenever stocks are transferred between labs.
-   **Procedure Type**: Husbandry
-   **Species**:
    -   Threespine stickleback, (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*)
-   **Author**: Mark Currey
-   **Date Created**: August 25, 2011, update February 29, 2014
-   **IACUC Protocol**: Covered under embryo handling and disease prevention procedures

::: {.callout-caution title="Chemical Hygiene"}
-   Wear gloves and eye protection when working with bleach
-   Work in well-ventilated area
-   Bleach can damage embryos if exposure time is too long
:::

::: {.callout-important title="Important"}
This procedure is critical for preventing pathogen introduction into established fish colonies. Always bleach embryos from wild-caught fish or when transferring between facilities.

## Materials

-   Wash bottle and petri dishes
-   Timer
-   Wide-blade entomology forceps
-   Transfer pipettes

## Solutions

-   6% sodium hypochlorite (standard bleach)
-   **Working stock of bleach**: Mix 500 µl of bleach into 1 liter of embryo medium (see @sec-general_recipe_embryo_medium)
-   Embryo medium (see @sec-general_recipe_embryo_medium)

## Procedure

1.  **Raise embryos**: Raise embryos according to standard crossing and rearing protocols in @sec-husbandry_stickleback_crossing.

2.  **Timing**: At 48-60 hours post-fertilization (@ 20°C - at this point most organogenesis is complete) remove embryo medium from petri dishes and rinse embryos once with fresh embryo medium.

3.  **Bleach treatment**: Fill petri dish with working stock solution of bleach. Swirl and let sit for 1.5 min.

::: {.callout-warning title="Important Timing"}
Do not bleach embryos for longer than 1.5 minutes as chorions can thicken and it becomes difficult for embryos to hatch.
:::

4.  **Rinse thoroughly**: Drain bleach solution from embryos, and wash them three times with fresh embryo medium. This is really important to remove all bleach residue.

5.  **Shipping embryos (optional)**: Replace embryo medium daily. If crosses are done in the field, the embryos can be shipped from day 3 to day 6 post-fertilization. To ship embryos:
    -   Rinse once with embryo medium
    -   Place embryos into a 50ml conical tube (~100 embryos/tube) and fill with fresh embryo medium
    -   Place tubes in a shipping container with wet ice
    -   Separate the tubes from the ice with bubble-wrap and newspapers
    -   Ship the embryos overnight

6.  **Receiving shipped embryos**: When the embryos arrive at the lab:
    -   Rinse the outside of the containers well before moving into the lab
    -   Allow them to equilibrate to room temp (~20°C)
    -   Place the embryos into petri dishes, rinse once, and add new embryo medium
    -   Rear according to standard protocol in @sec-husbandry_stickleback_crossing
