# Stickleback Embryo and Larval Euthanasia {#sec-husbandry_euthanasia_stickleback}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This procedure describes best practices for euthanizing embryonic and larval threespine stickleback.
-   **Procedure Type**: Vertebrate Husbandry
-   **Species**:
    -   Threespine stickleback, (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*)
-   **Author**: Mark Currey
-   **Date Created**: April 10, 2010, update January 1, 2014
-   **IACUC Protocol**: Required for all euthanasia procedures

::: {.callout-important title="IACUC Compliance"}
-   All euthanasia must be performed by trained personnel
-   Documented in laboratory records
-   Follow approved euthanasia protocols
-   Death must be confirmed before disposal or fixation
:::

::: {.callout-caution title="Chemical Safety"}
-   Tricaine (MS-222) can be absorbed through skin - always wear gloves
-   Work in well-ventilated area
-   Dispose of MS-222 solutions according to chemical waste protocols
:::

## Materials

-   Container to hold fish while being euthanized
-   Post mortem fixing equipment (if needed)
-   Morgue (if needed)
-   95% Ethanol
-   Gloves

## Solutions

-   **Mesab Stock Solution** - see @sec-general_recipe_mesab for detailed recipe:
    -   4 g tricaine powder
    -   979 ml DD water
    -   ~21 ml 1 M Tris (pH 9)
    -   Adjust pH to ~7
    -   Aliquot in 50ml tubes, label with MESAB Stock Solution 4g/L, and store in a -20 freezer
    -   This makes 1 liter of solution

-   **Euthanasia Solution (300 mg/L)**:
    -   Make Mesab stock solution or obtain an aliquot from the freezer
    -   Make a solution of 3.0 ppt Instant Ocean by adding 0.3 grams of Instant Ocean to 100 ml of DD water
    -   Combine 7.5ml of stock solution into 100 ml of 3 ppt Instant Ocean
    -   Store solution in an amber bottle to protect it from light and add mixed and expiration dates (6 months after being mixed) to the bottle

## Procedure

### Procedure for Embryo Euthanasia

1.  **Immerse in euthanasia solution**: Place embryos into a MS-222 euthanasia solution.

2.  **Wait for movement to stop**: Leave embryos in solution until movement has stopped, ~ 10 minutes.

3.  **Additional confirmation**: If fish is to be used for experiments, proceed with fixation or preparation for the experiment. If the fish are to be disposed of, place embryo in 95% ETOH for 5 minutes and then into morgue for disposal.

::: {.callout-warning title="Notes"}
The ethanol step is necessary as a startle response is not obvious in unhatched fish. This provides secondary confirmation of death.
:::

### Procedure for Larval Euthanasia

1.  **Immerse in euthanasia solution**: Place larva into a MS-222 euthanasia solution.

2.  **Wait and perform tap test**: Wait 10 minutes and perform a tap test to look for a startle response.

3.  **Repeat if necessary**: If there is a response wait 5 minutes and repeat startle response test. Repeat this step every 5 minutes as needed.

4.  **Confirm death**: If there is no response, death is confirmed. Move to fixing for post mortem experiments or place in morgue.
