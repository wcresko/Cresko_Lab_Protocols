## Materials

-   Dietrich's fixative (see @sec-general_recipe_dietrichs_fix)
-   50 ml tubes
-   Straight razor

## Solutions

-   Prepare Dietrich's Fixative (100 ml) as follows (see @sec-general_recipe_dietrichs_fix)
-   Store fixative at room temperature.
    -   30 ml Ethanol (95%)
    -   10 ml Formalin (Formaldehyde 37% solution, histological grade, contains 10-15% methanol, Sigma \# F1635)
    -   2 ml Glacial Acetic Acid
    -   58 ml Distilled Water

## Procedure

### Location and monitoring of sentinel tanks

1.  Sentinel fish are placed in tanks in both the Summer and Winter rooms.
2.  A subset of a stock cross can be used, allow fish to live in the water system for at least 2 weeks before sampling.
3.  Every 6 months four fish from each tank are fixed with Deitrich's fixative.
4.  Take fish to the Histology lab for Hematoxylin and Eosin staining and sectioning.
5.  Prepared slides are given to Dr. Kathy Snell for diagnosis.

### Fixing of Fish and Sectioning

1.  Fish are euthanized using MS222.
2.  Cut 2 cm segments starting just behind the eye to 2 cm caudally.
3.  Put these segments into Dietrich's fix for at least 24 hours.
4.  Parafin embedded sagital sections need to be done.
5.  Request cross sections through the gills and into the gut.

### Fish to Dr. Kathy Snell

1.  Arrange drop off of slides to Dr. Snell located in Huestis Hall, snellk\@uoregon.edu
