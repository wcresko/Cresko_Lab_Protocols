# Testes Storage {#sec-husbandry_testes_storage}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This procedure describes how to store stickleback testes for fertilization up to 1-2 months post extraction.
-   **Procedure Type**: Husbandry
-   **Species**:
    -   Threespine stickleback, (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*)
-   **Author**: Mark Currey
-   **Date Created**: May 6, 2008; updated January 15, 2015 by Mark Currey
-   **IACUC Protocol**: Covered under breeding and crossing procedures

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
Both Gentamycin and cell culture anti-biotic/mycotic reagents are located in separate boxes in the scientific -20°C freezer. They are partitioned into 100μl aliquots.

## Materials

-   15 ml falcon tube
-   4°C refrigerator
-   Gentamycin (antimycotic) (Stock - 10mg/ml)
-   Cell Culture anti-biotic/mycotic from Gibco-BRL (15240-096) 100x Concentration

## Solutions

-   **Ginzberg's Ringers** - see @sec-recipe_ginzbergs for detailed recipe:
    -   Mix solids into 750 ml of npH2O:
        -   6.6g NaCl
        -   0.25g KCl
        -   0.3g CaCl~2~
        -   0.2g NaHCO~3~
    -   Bring to 1 liter total volume with npH~2~O
    -   Store at 4°C

-   **Testes solution** (100ml) - see @sec-recipe_testes_solution for detailed recipe:
    -   Add 100μl of Gentamycin and 100μl of Anti-biotic/mycotic to 100ml of Ginzburg's Ringers solution
    -   Store at 4°C

## Procedure

1.  **Prepare solutions**: Make Ginzberg's Ringers and Testes solutions as described above.

2.  **Dissect testes**: Follow procedures in @sec-husbandry_stickleback_crossing for testes dissection.

3.  **Store in solution**: Place testes in 15 ml tube with ~10 ml of testes solution.

4.  **Label tube**: Label tube with stock number and date of testes dissection.

5.  **Refrigerate**: Place tube with testes in 4°C refrigerator.

6.  **Change solution weekly**: Change testes solution once per week to maintain viability.

::: {.callout-warning title="Notes"}
Testes can be used up to ~1-2 months when stored this way. Sperm viability decreases over time, so use fresher testes when possible for optimal fertilization rates.
