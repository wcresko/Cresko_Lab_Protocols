# Pipefish Water System Maintenance {#sec-husbandry_pipefish_tank_maint}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This procedure describes maintenance of the pipefish recirculating system. The pipefish system is a \~ 500 gallon recirculating salt water system. Water parameters: 25C, 25ppt salinity, no ammonia, no nitrites, and nitrates below 40 ppm.
-   **Procedure Type**: Husbandry
-   **Species**:
    -   Gulf pipefish (*Syngnathus scovelli*)

## Materials

-   Clean 20 gallon tanks
-   Clean tank hardware
-   Plastic plants
-   Gravel vacuum

## Procedure

**20 gallon adult pipefish tanks**

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
All 20 gallon pipefish tanks are cleaned and reset at least once a month.
:::

-   *Complete take down and cleaning*

    1.  After transferring fish to a clean tank, take down the old tank as described in @sec-vert_husb-aquarium_cleaning, but leave the bulkhead on and keep the substrate in the tank.
    2.  Put the strainer catch over the drain in the sink to prevent substrate from clogging the drain. Tilt the tank vertically so the substrate pools in the back.
    3.  Reset tank as described in @sec-vert_husb-aquarium_cleaning, but add at least 2 clean plastic plants to the tank for enrichment.
    4.  Circulate clean tanks 30 minutes before transferring fish.

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
If there are not enough open tanks to completely clean and reset 3-5 per week, use the gravel vac to clean all occupied tanks at least 1x per week:
:::

-   *Gravel Vac cleaning*

    1.  Use an empty bucket (with drain drilled in) to catch the water siphoned out of each tank.
    2.  Rinse gravel vac and tube with RO water.
    3.  Turn off water and air flow to the tank being cleaned.
    4.  Create a siphon with the gravel vac to begin draining the tank water into the bin. Keep a section of the gravel vac hose near the end pinched to control suction by pinching down to stop and releasing slightly to restart. Agitate substrate by "fluffing" up and down with the gravel vac.

::: {.callout-caution title="Caution"}
Do not allow water level to be drained below 5-6 inches in the sump. Immediately stop suction if a pipefish enters the gravel vac. Check the bin for any pipefish that may have been accidentally sucked into the gravel vac before moving to the next tank.
:::

**10.5 L pipefish fry tanks**

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
Fry are generally large enough to be transferred to clean 10L tanks at 2 months post-birth.
:::

1.  Set up new 10.5 L tanks band place a clean small plastic plant in the tank for enrichment.
2.  Uneaten food will build up quickly. Use a turkey baster and muck bucket to spot clean 2x per week or as needed.
3.  Replace the back 850 screen baffle in tanks when they appear clogged.

**Changing water in the system**

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
10-20% of the system water should be changed every week.
:::

1.  Drain system water by attaching a hose to one of the 20 gallon tanks supply placing the other end of the hose in the corner room drain. Turn on valve and allow water to drain until the water level is 3-5 inches above the basket that supplies the system pump (located left side of largest sump under 20 gallon rack).
2.  The makeup water vat should be full. Check makeup water salinity with a refractometer. Target salinity is \~25 ppt. Adjust salinity by adding salt or RO water if necessary. Put the end of the makeup water hose into the small sump.
3.  Turn makeup water pump on until makeup water drops to the drain line marked on the outside of the makeup water vat, then turn off. Lift the makeup water hose out of the sump and rest on the rim of the makeup water vat.
4.  To reset the makeup water vat, use the RO located in the northeast corner of the room to fill the vat up to the fill line. This take about 15 minutes.
5.  Use a 5 L beaker to measure 2.5 L of instant ocean and pour into makeup water vat. Recheck salinity after several minutes and adjust as necessary.
