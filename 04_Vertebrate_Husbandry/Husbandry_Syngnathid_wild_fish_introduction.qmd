## Materials

-   Empty 20 gallon Tank
-   Clean 5 gallon bucket

## Solutions

-   none

## Procedure

1.  When pipefish arrive remove them from packaging and float them in system water for 15-30 minutes to acclimate to the temperature.
2.  Pour contents of each bag of pipefish into a 5 gallon bucket.
3.  Slowly acclimate the new pipefish by adding 1/4 - 1/2 gallon of system water to the 5 gallon bucket over the course of a few hours. Do this until most of the water in the bucket is system water.
4.  Move pipefish (not water) to clean 20 gallon tank.
5.  Feed lightly for 2-3 days as the fish acclimate to captivity. Slowly introduce frozen mysids along with live mysids.
