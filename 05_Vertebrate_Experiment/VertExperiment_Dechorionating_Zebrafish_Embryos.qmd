# Dechorionating Zebrafish Embryos {#sec-vert_exp--zfish_dechorinate}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This procedure describes how to dechorionate zebrafish embryos.
-   **Procedure Type**: Vertebrate experiment
-   **Species**:
    -   Zebrafish (*Danio rerio*)
-   **Author**:
-   **Date Created**:

## Materials

-   Two pairs of Dumont #5 forceps
-   Fire-polished wide-bore Pasteur pipet
-   If using enzymatic dechorionation:
    -   6X flyfishing tippet
    -   Capillary tube
-   Microscope

## Solutions

-   E3 medium (quantities for 5 L of 60X stock listed after each ingredient in parentheses)
    -   5 mM NaCl (86 g)
    -   0.17 mM KCl (3.8 g)
    -   0.33 mM CaCl~2~ (14.5 g CaCl~2~ x 2H~2~O)
    -   0.333 mM MgSO~4~ (24.5 g MgSO~4~ x 7H~2~O)
    -   0.00001% (w/v) Methylene Blue (to be added to 1X solution)
-   2 mg/ml Pronase in E3 medium (Pronase Solution made from solid Powder (Roche 165921))

## Procedure

### Method 1: Manual Dechorionation

Chorions can be removed easily using two pairs of forceps. **Critical**: Forceps tips must be sharp and able to touch precisely.

1.  **Position embryo**: Place embryos in E3 medium in a petri dish under a dissecting microscope.

2.  **Tear chorion**:
    a.  Using one pair of forceps, gently hold the chorion to stabilize it.
    b.  With the other pair of forceps, make a small tear in the chorion.

3.  **Release embryo**:
    a.  Grasp the chorion on the side opposite the tear with one pair of forceps.
    b.  Gently push the embryo through the opening by passing the chorion and embryo between the tips of the other pair of forceps.
    c.  The embryo should slide out through the tear.

::: {.callout-warning title="Handle with Care"}
Embryos younger than 15 hours post fertilization (hpf) are particularly fragile and great care must be taken not to damage them. Work slowly and gently.

### Method 2: Enzymatic Dechorionation (Bulk Processing)

Alternatively, embryos can be enzymatically dechorionated in bulk:

1.  **Prepare embryos**: Collect embryos in a petri dish.

2.  **Pronase treatment**:
    -   Incubate embryos in Pronase Solution (2 mg/ml in E3) at room temperature.
    -   Duration: 1-10 minutes, depending on embryonic stage (older embryos require longer treatment).

3.  **Monitor chorion integrity**:
    -   Use a poker (made by attaching a loop of 6X flyfishing tippet to a capillary tube).
    -   Gently depress chorions under a microscope.
    -   When chorions no longer return to a spherical shape, the Pronase treatment is complete.

4.  **Wash embryos**:
    -   Thoroughly wash embryos 3-4 times in fresh E3 medium to remove all Pronase.
    -   Using a fire-polished wide-bore Pasteur pipette, gently pipette embryos back and forth.
    -   The weakened chorions should break open, releasing embryos.

5.  **Transfer dechorionated embryos**:
    -   Handle dechorionated embryos using only fire-polished Pasteur pipettes to minimize damage.
    -   Transfer to fresh E3 medium.

## Post-Dechorionation Care

::: {.callout-tip title="Maintaining Embryo Health"}
-   Keep dechorionated embryos in E3 medium at 28.5°C
-   Dechorionated embryos are more susceptible to bacterial contamination - maintain clean conditions
-   Remove dead embryos promptly
-   Change medium daily
-   Expect slightly higher mortality compared to chorionated embryos

## Troubleshooting

::: {.callout-warning title="Common Issues"}
-   **Embryos damaged during manual dechorionation**: Forceps may be too dull or technique too forceful; practice on older, more robust embryos first.
-   **Incomplete pronase digestion**: Increase pronase concentration or incubation time; check pronase activity.
-   **Over-digestion with pronase**: Embryos appear damaged or sticky; reduce incubation time and monitor more frequently.
-   **High mortality after dechorionation**: May indicate damage during processing; ensure pipettes are properly fire-polished and handle embryos gently.
