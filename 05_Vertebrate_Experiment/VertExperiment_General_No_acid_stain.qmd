::: {.callout-important title="IACUC Protocol Required"}
This procedure requires an active IACUC protocol covering tissue fixation and staining. Ensure specimens are properly euthanized before fixation.
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="Chemical Safety"}
-   Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, safety glasses) when handling fixatives and stains.
-   Paraformaldehyde (PFA) is a potential carcinogen - handle with care in a fume hood.
-   Hydrogen peroxide can cause burns - handle with care.
-   Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is corrosive - avoid skin contact.
-   Follow proper chemical waste disposal procedures.

## Background and Purpose

Alcian blue is a basic dye which stains acidic mucopolysaccharides. Traditionally alcian staining has utilized acidic conditions to stain cartilage. As acidic conditions negatively affect bone staining, simultaneous cartilage and bone staining is problematic. Also, since acid conditions destroy DNA, embryos to be alcian stained by the acid method AND also prepped for DNA have to be dissected into heads for alcian and tails for DNA. This process is laborious.

**The protocols below use MgCl~2~ rather than acid to differentiate staining**, preserving DNA integrity while allowing simultaneous cartilage and bone visualization.

::: {.callout-note title="Scale and Volumes"}
-   **Zebrafish embryos (4-6 dpf)**: Up to 100 embryos can be stained in a 1.5 ml tube, using 1 ml of stain/washes per tube.
-   **Young adult zebrafish (6 months old)**: Use 8X volume of stain/washes per volume of fish (roughly 40 ml solution per 20 fish).
-   **All steps are at room temperature with rocking unless otherwise noted.**

### Important Considerations

::: {.callout-warning title="Bone Stain Sensitivity"}
Bone staining is sensitive to protocol changes. It is easy to reduce or lose bone stain.

**Common issues**:
-   Reduction of bone stain is apparent when certain regions do not stain well (e.g., OP staining reduced in skirt region, Mx & den staining reduced or gone).
-   Staining tends to remain in denser regions such as CB5.

**Factors that reduce bone staining**:
-   **Overfixation** (even by just a few hours)
-   **Extended alizarin staining** (overnight vs. 30 min - longer is not necessarily better)
-   **Incomplete bleach removal** (especially when many embryos are stained in one tube)
-   **Trypsinization** (even minimal amounts can dramatically reduce bone stain)
-   **Detergents** (Tween at 0.05% can wipe out bone stain)

**Recommendation**: Follow protocol as written initially, then make adjustments as needed for your specific application.

### Protocol Variations

**For DNA preparations after staining**:
Rinse out 50% glycerol/0.1% KOH with 2X quick rinses in low TE plus a squirt of PBSTw. Sort embryos into 96-well plate, remove excess liquid, and lyse under standard conditions. The Tween in PBSTw will help prevent the embryos from getting sticky, but will also remove the bone stain.

**For cartilage-only staining**:
Longer fixes, even 4% PFA overnight, are fine. Cellular detail, including muscles, ligaments, and cartilage nuclei are quite good under Nomarski optics.

**For bone-only staining**:
PFA-fixed embryos have decreased bone fluorescence. For better bone fluorescence, fix and stain in 95% ethanol/0.01% alizarin overnight (one step). Do not use MgCl~2~ in washes, and extend washes to 10 minutes. Embryos will be soft due to light fixation.

## Solutions

### Solutions for embryos

-   **2% PFA/1X PBS pH 7.5**

    *For 1 ml, add:*

    -   250ul 8% PFA
    -   100ul 10X PBS
    -   650ul water
    -   100mM Tris pH 7.5/10mM MgCl~2~

-   **0.2% alcian blue/90% ETOH**

::: {.callout-note title="Preparation Note"}
Alcian blue will not readily dissolve in 90% ETOH. To make 100 ml: add 0.2 g alcian blue 8GX powder to 11.2 ml 50% ETOH. Warm and occasionally swirl. When all is dissolved, add 95% ETOH to 100 ml. Check clarity of solution under a microscope to make sure there are no precipitates.

## Procedure

1.  **Fixation**: Fix in 2% PFA/1X PBS for 1 hour.

::: {.callout-note title="Fixation Time Optimization"}
Fixing times can vary depending on the size of the specimen. For 5-10 mm stickleback and pipefish, a fix of 2-3 hours is sufficient. **Do not overfix** as this can reduce bone staining quality.
:::

2.  **Rehydration**: Rinse in 50% ETOH/water for 10 minutes.

3.  **Double staining**: Add 0.04% Alcian Blue/0.01% Alizarin Red S/10 mM MgCl~2~/80% ETOH.
    -   Add Alizarin Red just before use (add 20 μl 0.5% alizarin red per 1 ml of 0.04% alcian stock).

::: {.callout-warning title="Staining Time"}
With very small specimens it's very easy to overstain. Check amount of staining every 30 minutes until the desired level of staining has been achieved.

**Important**: Store stock as 0.04% Alcian Blue/10 mM MgCl~2~/80% ETOH (without alizarin red). Add alizarin fresh for each use.
:::

4.  **First rinse**: Rinse in 80% ETOH/10 mM MgCl~2~/water for 10 minutes to overnight.
    -   Note: Cleaner Alcian background with longer rinses.

5.  **Rehydration**: Rinse in 50% ETOH/water for 5 minutes.

6.  **Rehydration**: Rinse in 25% ETOH/water for 5 minutes.

7.  **Bleaching**: Treat with 3% H~2~O~2~/0.5% KOH for 10 minutes with lids open.

8.  **Rinse**: Rinse thoroughly with water.

9.  **Clearing**: Rinse with 50% Isopropanol.

10. **Storage**: Store in 50% Isopropanol.
