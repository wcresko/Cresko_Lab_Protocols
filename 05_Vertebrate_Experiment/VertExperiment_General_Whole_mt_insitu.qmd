::: {.callout-important title="IACUC Protocol Required"}
This procedure requires an active IACUC protocol covering tissue fixation and processing. Ensure all personnel are properly trained.
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="Chemical Safety"}
-   Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, safety glasses) when handling paraformaldehyde (PFA).
-   Work in a fume hood when preparing or using PFA solutions.
-   PFA is a fixative and potential carcinogen - handle with care.
-   Acetone is flammable - keep away from ignition sources.
-   Sodium azide is toxic - handle with care and dispose of properly.

## Materials

-   Ice
-   Distilled water
-   Primary antibody (e.g., mouse anti-fish specific antibody)
-   Secondary antibody (e.g., goat anti-mouse)
-   Tertiary antibody (e.g., mouse PAP - peroxidase-antiperoxidase)
-   Water bath or incubator (35-40°C)
-   Shaker/rocker (optional, for antibody incubations)
-   Microcentrifuge tubes or small vials for embryo processing

## Solutions

-   8% PFA - see @sec-general_recipe_8%PFA
-   **BT fix**: 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS
-   **0.1 M sodium citrate buffer**, pH 6.4
-   **Citrate buffer with sodium azide**: 0.1 M citrate buffer containing 0.1% sodium azide
-   **Acetone** (stored at -20°C for permeabilization step)
-   **Blocking solution**: 2% normal goat serum in wash solution
-   **Wash solution**: PBS containing 1% BSA, 1% DMSO, 0.2% Triton X-100

## Procedure

### Day 1: Fixation

1.  Fix embryos in BT Fix for 4 to 6 hours on ice or at 4°C (see notes below for fixative composition considerations).

### Day 1-2: Modified Antigen Retrieval

2.  Wash embryos in 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.4, for 5 minutes.

3.  Replace with fresh citrate buffer containing 0.1% sodium azide.

4.  Incubate overnight in 35-40°C water bath (see optimization notes below).

### Day 2: Acetone Permeabilization

5.  Wash in distilled water for 5 minutes.

6.  Transfer to acetone at -20°C for 7 minutes to permeabilize the tissue.

7.  Wash in distilled water for 5 minutes.

8.  Wash in 0.1 M citrate buffer for 5 minutes.

### Day 2-3: Immunohistochemistry

9.  Treat with blocking solution (2% normal goat serum in wash solution) to block nonspecific binding sites for 30 minutes at room temperature.

10. Incubate with **primary antibody** (e.g., mouse anti-fish) diluted in blocking solution:
    -   5 hours at room temperature, OR
    -   Overnight at 4°C
    -   Optional: Use a shaker or rocker to facilitate antibody penetration.

11. Wash for approximately 2 hours with frequent changes of wash solution (every 15-20 minutes).

12. Incubate with **secondary antibody** (e.g., goat anti-mouse) diluted in wash solution:
    -   Overnight at 4°C, OR
    -   5 hours at room temperature

13. Wash for approximately 2 hours with frequent changes of wash solution.

14. **If using a tertiary antibody**: Incubate with tertiary antibody (e.g., mouse PAP) diluted in wash buffer:
    -   Overnight at 4°C, OR
    -   5 hours at room temperature

15. Wash for approximately 2 hours with frequent changes of wash solution.

16. **If required**: Develop enzyme-mediated stain according to the specific detection system being used.

## Optimization Notes

::: {.callout-note title="Fixative Composition"}
Comparative testing of different aldehyde fixatives showed:

-   **4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.3)**: Poorly and incompletely stained.
-   **BT fix or 4% PFA in PBS**: Demonstrated robust staining throughout the head and trunk of the fish (BT-fixed fish showed slightly better results).
-   **BT fix components**: The 4% sucrose in BT fix was required for high-quality staining.
-   **Calcium in BT fix**: The quality of staining in fish fixed in BT fixative without calcium was comparable to that of fish fixed in BT fix containing 0.15 mM calcium chloride.

**Recommendation**: Use BT fix or 4% PFA in PBS for optimal results.

::: {.callout-note title="Modified Antigen Retrieval Optimization"}
Antigen-retrieval methods were first introduced in the early 1990s and have been widely adopted by the clinical community as a way to recover antigenicity in paraffin sections.

**Temperature optimization**: Several studies have demonstrated that heat is one of the most important variables in antigen retrieval (Brain Res 632:105-113, 1993; Pathol Int 44:759-764, 1994; APMIS 102:295-307, 1994).

**Experimental results**:
-   Overnight incubations were tested at four temperatures: 4°C, room temperature, 37°C, and 44°C.
-   **4°C or room temperature**: 5-day embryos were poorly and incompletely stained.
-   **37°C and 44°C**: Embryos were stained robustly throughout the head and trunk.
-   **44°C**: High background staining was observed.
-   **37°C**: No background staining present - optimal temperature.

**Recommendation**: Use 37-40°C for overnight incubation. Embryos incubated at 4°C can serve as negative controls.
