::: {.callout-important title="Safety and Handling"}
-   Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, safety glasses)
-   Alizarin is a dye that can stain skin and clothing
-   Keep staining solutions in dark containers to prevent degradation
-   Dispose of staining solutions according to chemical waste protocols

## Background

Alizarin red S is a calcium-binding dye that selectively binds to mineralized bone tissue, making it fluorescent under specific wavelengths. This allows for *in vivo* visualization of the skeleton in live fish without fixation. The staining is reversible, allowing fish to recover and be used for subsequent experiments or returned to normal husbandry.

## Materials

-   Large Petri dishes (100mm diameter) or small tanks
-   Darkened containers or aluminum foil
-   Transfer pipettes
-   Alizarin Red S powder (SIGMA cat# A5533, certified)
-   Sterile water
-   NaOH solution (10%)
-   pH meter or pH strips

## Solutions

### Alizarin Stock Solution (0.5% or 1%)

-   **0.5% Stock**: 0.5g Alizarin Red S in 100ml sterile water
-   **1.0% Stock**: 1.0g Alizarin Red S in 100ml sterile water (or 0.5g in 50ml)
-   Store in dark bottle at room temperature for up to 6 months
-   Make fresh if precipitation occurs

### Staining Solutions

Preparation varies by species due to different osmotic requirements:

-   Adjust to pH 7.5 with NaOH

#### Pipefish/Syngnathid

**For 1 Liter** (large scale):

-   990 ml 25 ppt Instant Ocean (artificial seawater)
-   10 ml Alizarin stock (0.5% or 1%)
-   Final concentration: 0.005% or 0.01%
-   Adjust to pH 7.5 with NaOH

**For 50 ml** (single petri dish):

-   49.5 ml 25 ppt Instant Ocean
-   500 µl Alizarin stock (0.5% or 1%)
-   Adjust to pH 7.5 with NaOH

### Additional Solutions

-   MESAB anesthesia strength (see @sec-husbandry_anesth_stickleback for stickleback, @sec-husbandry_anesth_pipefish for pipefish)
-   MESAB euthanasia strength (see @sec-husbandry_euthanasia_stickleback for stickleback, @sec-husbandry-pipefish_larval_euth for pipefish)

## Procedure

### Preparation (Day Before if Possible)

1.  Prepare staining solution fresh or use within 1 week of preparation
2.  Verify pH is 7.5 ± 0.2
3.  Cover container with aluminum foil to protect from light
4.  Pre-label all containers with fish ID, date, and treatment

### Staining Protocol

::: {.callout-tip title="Staining Duration Guidelines"}
-   **Larvae**: 1-2 hours
-   **Juveniles**: 2-6 hours
-   **Adults**: Overnight (8-16 hours)
-   Longer exposures generally produce brighter staining but monitor fish welfare
:::

1.  **Transfer fish** to container with staining solution

    -   Use appropriate volume (50ml for 1-5 larvae, 500ml-1L for larger fish)
    -   Ensure adequate oxygenation for overnight staining (gentle aeration or frequent water changes)

2.  **Incubate in darkness**

    -   Cover container with aluminum foil or place in dark location
    -   Maintain appropriate temperature (16-20°C for stickleback, 18-22°C for pipefish)

3.  **Monitor fish** during staining period

    -   Check every 30-60 minutes for shorter staining periods
    -   Check every 2-4 hours for overnight staining
    -   Ensure fish are swimming normally and not stressed

### De-staining and Imaging

4.  **Rinse fish** to remove background staining

    -   Transfer fish to fresh medium/seawater (appropriate for species)
    -   Rinse for 30 minutes minimum
    -   Background fluorescence will continue to decrease over time
    -   Can perform 2-3 rinses for better signal-to-background ratio

5.  **Optional: Sequential DASPEI staining**

    -   If desired, proceed to DASPEI live staining (see @sec-vert_exp-live_daspei)
    -   DASPEI can be performed on already alizarin-stained fish

6.  **Anesthetize for imaging**

    -   Place fish in anesthesia solution (appropriate strength for species)
    -   Wait until movement slows sufficiently for safe handling
    -   Aim for light plane of anesthesia (reduced gill movement, loss of equilibrium)

7.  **Observe and image**

    -   Alizarin fluorescence: Excitation ~530-560nm, Emission ~570-600nm (red)
    -   Plan imaging for same day as staining for best results
    -   Keep fish in dark between imaging sessions to preserve fluorescence

::: {.callout-warning title="Important Imaging Notes"}
-   Bone fluorescence **decreases over time** - plan to image within 24 hours of staining
-   Keep fish in darkness as much as possible to preserve fluorescence
-   Use minimal exposure to excitation light to prevent photobleaching
:::

### Recovery

8.  **Transfer fish to recovery tank**

    -   Use fresh medium/seawater at appropriate temperature
    -   Ensure adequate oxygenation

9.  **Monitor recovery**

    -   Check fish every 5-10 minutes
    -   Look for return of normal swimming behavior
    -   Typical recovery time: 5-20 minutes depending on anesthesia depth

10. **Return to system or proceed to next step**

    -   If recovering well: return to normal husbandry system
    -   Monitor during next daily health check
    -   If proceeding to fixation: transfer to euthanasia solution (see appropriate euthanasia SOP for species)

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Weak or no staining | pH too low/high | Verify pH is 7.5 ± 0.2 |
| | Old alizarin stock | Make fresh stock solution |
| | Insufficient staining time | Increase staining duration |
| High background | Insufficient rinsing | Extend rinse period or do multiple rinses |
| | Staining solution too concentrated | Use lower concentration (0.005% instead of 0.01%) |
| Fish stress/mortality | Staining solution too concentrated | Dilute solution to 0.005% |
| | Inadequate oxygenation | Add gentle aeration or change solution every 4 hours |
| Rapid fluorescence loss | Excessive light exposure | Keep fish in dark; minimize excitation light |
| | Too much time post-staining | Image within 24 hours of staining |
