## Background

Calcein is a fluorescent compound that binds to calcium in mineralized bone tissue, making it visible under fluorescence microscopy. Unlike alizarin which binds to the surface of mineralized structures, calcein is incorporated into actively mineralizing bone, making it particularly useful for visualizing bone formation and growth. This allows for *in vivo* visualization of the skeleton in live fish without fixation. The staining is reversible, allowing fish to recover and be used for subsequent experiments or returned to normal husbandry.

Calcein fluoresces green when excited with blue light (excitation ~495nm, emission ~515nm), providing excellent contrast and can be used in combination with other fluorescent markers like alizarin red (red fluorescence) or DASPEI (yellow-green fluorescence for neuromasts).

## Materials

### Additional Solutions

-   MESAB anesthesia strength (see @sec-husbandry_anesth_stickleback for stickleback, @sec-husbandry_anesth_pipefish for pipefish)
-   MESAB euthanasia strength (see @sec-husbandry_euthanasia_stickleback for stickleback, @sec-husbandry-pipefish_larval_euth for pipefish)

## Procedure

### Preparation (Day Before if Possible)

1.  Prepare staining solution fresh or use within 1 week of preparation
2.  Verify pH is 8.2 ± 0.2
3.  Cover container with aluminum foil to protect from light
4.  Pre-label all containers with fish ID, date, and treatment

### Staining Protocol

::: {.callout-tip title="Staining Duration Guidelines"}
-   **Larvae**: 1-2 hours
-   **Juveniles**: 2-6 hours (up to overnight)
-   **Adults**: 4 hours to overnight
-   Longer exposures generally produce brighter staining but monitor fish welfare
-   Fish can tolerate extended exposure without adverse effects
:::

1.  **Transfer fish** to container with staining solution

    -   Larvae: Use Petri dishes with 50-100ml staining solution
    -   Juveniles/Adults: Use 1L tanks or larger containers with appropriate volume
    -   Ensure adequate volume for fish size and number (minimum 50ml per small fish)
    -   Ensure adequate oxygenation for overnight staining (gentle aeration if needed)

2.  **Incubate in darkness**

    -   Cover container with aluminum foil or place in dark location
    -   Maintain appropriate temperature:
        -   Stickleback: 16-20°C
        -   Pipefish: 18-22°C

3.  **Monitor fish** during staining period

    -   Check every 30-60 minutes for short staining periods (1-2 hours)
    -   Check every 2-4 hours for extended staining periods
    -   Ensure fish are swimming normally and not stressed
    -   Stagger fish if imaging multiple individuals to avoid over-staining

::: {.callout-note title="Monitoring Staining Progress"}
For critical experiments, you can check staining intensity by briefly anesthetizing one fish and imaging under fluorescence microscopy, then returning it to the staining solution if more time is needed.
:::

### De-staining and Recovery

4.  **Rinse fish** to remove background staining

    -   Transfer fish to fresh medium/seawater (appropriate for species)
    -   Rinse for 20-60 minutes minimum
    -   Background fluorescence will continue to decrease over time
    -   Can perform 2-3 rinses of 30 minutes each for better signal-to-background ratio

5.  **Optional: Sequential staining**

    -   If desired, proceed to DASPEI live staining (see @sec-vert_exp-live_daspei)
    -   DASPEI can be performed on already calcein-stained fish
    -   Alizarin staining (see @sec-vert_exp-live_alizarin) can also be combined but may require optimization

### Imaging

6.  **Anesthetize for imaging**

    -   Place fish in anesthesia solution (appropriate strength for species)
    -   Wait until fish reaches a light plane of anesthesia
    -   Aim for reduced gill movement and loss of equilibrium but not complete cessation of breathing

7.  **Observe and image**

    -   Calcein fluorescence: Excitation ~495nm, Emission ~515nm (green)
    -   Bone fluorescence will decrease over time - plan to image same day if possible
    -   Keep fish in the dark as much as reasonably convenient between imaging sessions
    -   Use minimal exposure to excitation light to prevent photobleaching

::: {.callout-warning title="Important Imaging Notes"}
-   Bone fluorescence **decreases over time** - plan to image within 24 hours of staining
-   Keep fish in darkness between imaging sessions to preserve fluorescence
-   Use minimal exposure to excitation light to prevent photobleaching
-   Consider batch processing: stagger staining start times if imaging multiple fish
:::

### Recovery

8.  **Transfer fish to recovery container**

    -   Use clean system water or fresh medium at appropriate temperature
    -   Place in container of fish water
    -   Ensure adequate oxygenation

9.  **Monitor recovery**

    -   Check fish every 5-10 minutes until revived
    -   Look for return of normal swimming behavior and equilibrium
    -   Typical recovery time: 5-20 minutes depending on anesthesia depth

10. **Return to system or proceed to next step**

    -   Once fish is revived and swimming upright: return to fish system
    -   Monitor during daily health checks
    -   If proceeding to fixation: transfer to euthanasia solution (see appropriate euthanasia SOP for species)

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Weak or no staining | pH too low/high | Verify pH is 8.2 ± 0.2 |
| | Old calcein stock | Make fresh stock solution |
| | Insufficient staining time | Increase staining duration |
| | Concentration too low | Use higher concentration (0.05% for adults) |
| High background fluorescence | Insufficient rinsing | Extend rinse period or do multiple rinses |
| | Staining solution too concentrated | Use lower concentration (0.005-0.01%) |
| | Inadequate dark adaptation | Keep fish in dark for longer before imaging |
| Fish stress/mortality | Staining solution too concentrated | Dilute solution to 0.005-0.01% |
| | Inadequate oxygenation | Add gentle aeration or change solution |
| | Overcrowding | Reduce number of fish per container |
| Rapid fluorescence loss | Excessive light exposure | Keep fish in dark; minimize excitation light |
| | Too much time post-staining | Image within 24 hours of staining |
| Uneven staining | Fish not fully submerged | Ensure adequate solution volume |
| | Dead/dying tissue | Check fish health before staining |
