:::

## Background

Fin clipping is a common procedure in fish research for obtaining tissue samples for genetic analysis (DNA extraction, genotyping, parentage analysis) or for individual identification (mark-recapture studies). The caudal fin (tail fin) is typically used because it:

1.  Contains sufficient tissue for DNA extraction
2.  Regenerates completely in most fish species
3.  Has minimal impact on swimming ability when clipped properly
4.  Is easily accessible and visible

Proper technique is essential to minimize stress, prevent infection, and ensure fish welfare. The procedure involves brief anesthesia, quick removal of a small portion of the caudal fin blade (avoiding the peduncle), and recovery in clean water with antibacterial treatment.

## Materials

-   Beakers or small containers for anesthesia and recovery (200-500ml)
-   Fine-tipped scissors (sterilized)
-   Fine-tipped forceps (sterilized)
-   Bucket of ice
-   1.5ml microcentrifuge tubes (pre-labeled)
-   Transfer pipettes
-   Paper towels or kimwipes
-   Waste container

-   MESAB euthanasia strength for pipefish (see @sec-husbandry-pipefish_larval_euth)

## Procedure

### Preparation (Critical for Minimizing Anesthesia Exposure)

::: {.callout-tip title="Preparation is Key"}
Complete ALL labeling and setup before anesthetizing fish to minimize their exposure to MS-222. Fish should spend the minimum time necessary under anesthesia.
:::

1.  **Label all materials** before starting

    -   Label 1.5ml tubes with fish ID, date, and project code
    -   Arrange tubes in rack on ice
    -   Prepare data sheet for recording fish IDs and clip times

2.  **Prepare solutions**

    -   Anesthesia beaker: 200-500ml MS-222 at appropriate concentration
    -   Recovery beaker 1: 200-500ml clean system water
    -   Recovery beaker 2: 200-500ml system water with Melafix
    -   Label each beaker clearly

3.  **Sterilize instruments**

    -   Wipe scissors and forceps with 70% ethanol
    -   Allow to air dry or wipe with sterile gauze
    -   Re-sterilize between fish or when switching between family groups to prevent cross-contamination

### Anesthesia and Fin Clipping

4.  **Transfer fish to anesthesia solution**

    -   Use transfer pipette or small net
    -   Start timer to monitor anesthesia duration
    -   Target: minimum time necessary for safe handling

5.  **Monitor anesthesia progression**

    -   Watch operculum (gill cover) movement - it will slow
    -   Fish will lose equilibrium and turn on side
    -   Wait for light plane of anesthesia (reduced movement, slowed breathing)
    -   Typical time: 1-3 minutes depending on fish size and temperature

::: {.callout-note title="Signs of Appropriate Anesthesia"}
-   Reduced opercular movement (slowed breathing)
-   Loss of equilibrium (fish turns on side)
-   Reduced response to stimuli
-   Fish should still show gill movement (NOT complete cessation of breathing)
:::

6.  **Remove fish from anesthesia and clip fin**

    -   Use forceps to gently lift fish from beaker
    -   Place on clean, damp paper towel or kimwipe
    -   Keep fish moist during procedure
    -   Use scissors and forceps to remove portion of caudal fin blade
    -   **CRITICAL**: Avoid the caudal peduncle (base of tail where it meets body)
    -   Remove approximately 2-5mm of fin depending on fish size
    -   Make clean, quick cuts to minimize tissue damage

::: {.callout-warning title="Critical Anatomical Landmark"}
The **caudal peduncle** is the narrow base of the tail where it connects to the body. **NEVER** clip into this region as it contains major blood vessels and nerve cords. Cutting this area can cause:

-   Severe bleeding
-   Permanent swimming impairment
-   Death

Always clip only the **fin blade** (the thin, flexible part of the tail fin).
:::

7.  **Preserve tissue sample**

    -   Immediately place fin clip into pre-labeled 1.5ml tube on ice
    -   Ensure tube is properly labeled and sealed
    -   Note any observations (fish ID, clip size, anomalies)

### Recovery and Post-Procedure Care

8.  **Initiate recovery**

    -   Immediately place fish into recovery beaker with clean system water
    -   Gently move fish back and forth to force water over gills
    -   This helps restore normal respiration

9.  **Monitor recovery**

    -   Watch for return of opercular movement (gill beating)
    -   Look for fish to right itself (regain equilibrium)
    -   Continue gentle agitation until fish begins swimming
    -   Typical recovery time: 30 seconds to 3 minutes

10. **Antibacterial/antifungal treatment**

    -   Once fish is swimming upright, transfer to beaker with Melafix solution
    -   Leave fish in Melafix for 15 minutes
    -   This prevents infection at the wound site
    -   Continue monitoring during treatment

11. **Return to system**

    -   After Melafix treatment, return fish to home tank or appropriate system location
    -   Monitor fish for at least 5 minutes after return
    -   Check that fish swims normally and shows no signs of distress
    -   Flag tank/container for daily health monitoring over next 3-5 days

### Sample Storage

12. **Process tissue samples**

    -   Keep samples on ice during procedure
    -   Transfer to -20°C or -80°C freezer for long-term storage
    -   Alternatively, preserve in 95-100% ethanol for DNA extraction
    -   Record sample locations in lab database

## Post-Procedure Monitoring

::: {.callout-important title="Health Monitoring Schedule"}
Monitor clipped fish daily for at least 3-5 days post-procedure:

-   **Day 1-2**: Check 2x daily for signs of stress, infection, or behavioral changes
-   **Day 3-5**: Check 1x daily during normal health checks
-   **Signs of concern**: Lethargy, rapid breathing, refusal to eat, white/fuzzy growth on fin (fungal infection), erratic swimming
-   Document any issues and consult with IACUC/veterinarian if problems arise
:::

### Expected Recovery Timeline

-   **Hours 0-4**: Fish may be slightly less active, fin regeneration begins
-   **Days 1-3**: Transparent tissue forms at wound edge, fish returns to normal behavior
-   **Weeks 1-2**: Fin begins to regenerate ray structure
-   **Weeks 4-8**: Complete regeneration (varies by species, age, and fin size removed)

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Excessive bleeding | Cut into caudal peduncle | Apply pressure with damp gauze; monitor closely; consult veterinarian if bleeding continues >2 min |
| | Cut too large for fish size | Use smaller clips; ensure scissors are sharp |
| Slow or no recovery | Over-anesthetized | Increase water flow over gills; ensure fresh water; continue monitoring; most fish recover with time |
| | Water temperature too different | Ensure anesthesia and recovery water are same temperature as home tank |
| Infection/fungal growth | Contaminated instruments | Sterilize instruments between fish; ensure Melafix treatment |
| | Stressed/immunocompromised fish | Do not clip fish showing prior signs of disease; ensure water quality is optimal |
| Fish dies during/after procedure | Anesthesia overdose | Reduce anesthesia time; check MS-222 concentration |
| | Cut into peduncle | Review anatomy; practice technique on euthanized fish first |
| Difficulty handling fish | Fish too small | Consider postponing until fish is larger (minimum ~20mm for most species) |
| | Fish too active | Ensure adequate anesthesia depth before removing from water |
| Fin doesn't regenerate | Damage to fin base | Ensure future clips avoid the very base of fin rays |
| | Fish health issues | Monitor overall fish health and water quality |

## Species-Specific Considerations

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Stickleback

-   **Size recommendations**: Can clip fish as small as 20-25mm total length
-   **Anesthesia**: Use stickleback-specific MS-222 concentration
-   **Recovery temperature**: 16-20°C
-   **Regeneration time**: 4-6 weeks for complete regeneration
-   **Notes**: Hardy species, generally tolerate procedure well
-   Pectoral or pelvic spines may prick handler - use care

### Pipefish

-   **Size recommendations**: Clip fish >30mm total length (pipefish are more delicate)
-   **Anesthesia**: Use pipefish-specific MS-222 concentration (typically 168 mg/L)
-   **Recovery temperature**: 18-22°C
-   **Regeneration time**: 6-8 weeks (slower than stickleback)
-   **Notes**: More delicate than stickleback; handle gently
-   Elongated body shape requires careful positioning during procedure
-   Monitor more closely post-procedure

## Alternative Methods

### Non-Invasive Sampling (Future Consideration)

For some applications, consider non-lethal alternatives:

-   **Scale sampling**: For species with large scales (not applicable to most stickleback/pipefish)
-   **Mucus sampling**: Emerging technique for eDNA analysis
-   **Buccal swabs**: Less invasive but yields less DNA
-   **Visual marking**: PIT tags or visible implant elastomer for identification without sampling

### Lethal Sampling

If fish will be euthanized for other purposes, collect tissue then rather than fin clipping:

-   Larger tissue sample available
-   No recovery period needed
-   No infection risk
-   See species-specific euthanasia SOPs
