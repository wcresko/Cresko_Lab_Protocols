# Germ-Free Stickleback {#sec-vert_exp-gremfree_SB}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This procedure describes the creation of germ-free threespine stickleback for microbiome research and controlled colonization experiments.
-   **Procedure Type**: Vert Experiment
-   **Species**:
    -   Threespine stickleback, (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*)
-   **Author**: Mark Currey
-   **Date Created**: January 01, 2024

::: {.callout-important title="IACUC Protocol Required"}
This procedure requires an active IACUC protocol covering embryo sterilization and germ-free rearing. Ensure all personnel are properly trained in aseptic technique.
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="Sterile Technique Critical"}
Maintaining sterility is essential for successful germ-free fish production. All work must be performed in a tissue culture hood using sterile technique. Any break in sterility can compromise the entire experiment.

## Procedure

### Day 0: Embryo Collection and Initial Sterilization

1.  **Collect embryos**: Make crosses according to @sec-husbandry_stickleback_crossing, **except** spray the outside of the euthanized male with 95% ethanol prior to dissection.

2.  **Initial incubation**: Incubate eggs at 20°C until eggs reach 2-cell stage (~2 hours post fertilization).
    -   Remove non-viable embryos from 2-cell stage eggs.
    -   Rinse viable embryos with fresh antibiotic stickleback medium 2X.
### Sterilization (6 hours post fertilization)

3.  **Prepare for hood work**: About 6 hours post fertilization, transfer viable embryos into 50 ml beakers.

::: {.callout-note title="Sterile Technique"}
Wear standard latex laboratory gloves for all subsequent steps to increase the probability of maintaining sterility.
:::

4.  **Transfer materials to hood**: Move the following into the tissue culture hood to minimize entry/exit (materials listed are per 100 embryos cleaned):
    -   3 sterile 50 ml beakers with foil tops
    -   Individually wrapped, sterile transfer pipettes
    -   1 L filter-sterilized stickleback medium
    -   0.003% bleach solution
    -   0.2-0.4% PVP-I solution (Note: some flasks may be contaminated with 0.2% PVP-I, but more fish are likely to die in 0.4% PVP-I)
    -   10 sterile flasks (250 or 500 cm²) with screw-top caps
        -   In hood, add 48 ml sterile stickleback medium per 250 cm² flask OR 98 ml per 500 cm² flask before adding embryos
    -   25 ml or 50 ml sterile serological pipettes, individually wrapped
    -   Pipette aid
    -   Embryos in 50 ml covered beaker
    -   Large beaker for collecting liquid waste

### Embryo Washing and Sterilization

5.  **First transfer**: Transfer embryos to clean beaker.

6.  **Remove medium**: Pour off all but ~10 ml SM carefully into waste container.

7.  **Transfer**: Transfer remaining 10 ml SM with eggs into clean 50 ml beaker.

8.  **Collect remaining embryos**: Add ~20 ml sterile SM to old beaker to collect remaining eggs.

9.  **Combine**: Transfer remaining eggs to beaker.

10. **Adjust volume**: Bring volume in new beaker up to 50 ml with sterile SM.

11. **Rinse**: Rinse embryos 3X with 50 ml filter-sterilized SM.

12. **PVP-I treatment**: Immerse embryos in ~50 ml of 0.2-0.4% PVP-I solution for 10 minutes.

13. **Rinse**: Rinse embryos with sterile SM 1X.

14. **Transfer to fresh beaker**: Transfer embryos to fresh beaker (as in step 5).

15. **Additional rinses**: Rinse embryos in sterile SM additional 2X.

16. **Bleach treatment**: Immerse embryos in 0.003% bleach for 10 minutes.

17. **Rinse**: Rinse embryos in sterile SM 1X.

18. **Final transfer**: Transfer embryos to fresh beaker.

19. **Final rinses**: Rinse embryos additional 2X in sterile SM.

20. **Flask loading**: Transfer 20-40 embryos to each flask containing sterile SM using sterile, individually wrapped pipettes.

21. **Incubation**: Incubate embryos at 20°C in incubator.

### Post-Sterilization Care

22. **Feeding (9 dpf)**: At 9 days post fertilization, upon yolk absorption:
    -   Feed larvae with irradiated food
    -   Change water
    -   Test water for bacterial contamination

23. **Daily monitoring**:
    -   Record the number of fish dead or not moving in response to external stimuli on the daily checklist.
    -   In tissue culture hood, remove dead or non-responsive (sick) fish.
    -   Euthanize sick fish with tricaine - see @sec-husbandry_euthanasia_stickleback

24. **Water changes**: In tissue culture hood, remove 70% of fish water with sterile pipette.

25. **Replace medium**: Replace water with sterile stickleback medium.

26. **Feeding**: Add one scoop of irradiated Ziegler dry food to flask.

27. **Contamination testing**: Plate 50-100 μl of water on TSA plates to check for bacterial contamination.

## Quality Control

::: {.callout-tip title="Monitoring Sterility"}
-   Plate water samples on TSA plates at regular intervals (every 2-3 days)
-   Any bacterial growth indicates contamination
-   Remove contaminated flasks immediately
-   Keep detailed records of contamination rates

## Troubleshooting

::: {.callout-warning title="Common Issues"}
-   **High contamination rates**: Check sterile technique, filter integrity, and PVP-I/bleach concentrations.
-   **High mortality**: May indicate over-sterilization; try reducing PVP-I concentration to 0.2% or reducing bleach exposure time.
-   **Poor growth**: Ensure irradiated food is fresh and feeding amounts are appropriate.
