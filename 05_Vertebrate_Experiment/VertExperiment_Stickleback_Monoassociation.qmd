# Stickleback Bacterial Monoassociation {#sec-vert_exp-mono_ass_SB}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This protocol is used to determine whether specific bacterial strains can colonize the gut of germ-free stickleback, and to study host-microbe interactions in a controlled manner. This protocol has been adapted for use in stickleback from established, approved zebrafish protocols.
-   **Procedure Type**: Vert Experiment
-   **Species**:
    -   Threespine stickleback, (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*)
-   **Author**: Adapted from Guillemin laboratory protocols
-   **Date Created**: January 01, 2024

::: {.callout-important title="IACUC and IBC Protocol Required"}
This procedure requires:
-   An active IACUC protocol covering germ-free fish rearing and experimental manipulations
-   An active IBC (Institutional Biosafety Committee) protocol if using recombinant or pathogenic bacteria
-   Proper biosafety training for all personnel
:::

## Materials

-   Sterile tissue culture hood
-   Germ-free stickleback larvae (9-13 dpf) in sterile flasks
-   250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks for bacterial culture
-   Shaking incubator (25°C, 200 RPM)
-   Spectrophotometer for OD~600~ measurements
-   Sterile serological pipettes and pipette aid
-   Bacterial culture plates (TSA or appropriate medium)
-   Sterile spreaders or glass beads for plating

## Solutions

-   Sterile stickleback medium (filter sterilized) - see @sec-general_recipe_embryo_medium
-   Appropriate bacterial growth medium (e.g., LB, TSB, or specialized medium)
-   MS-222 euthanasia solution for endpoint - see @sec-husb-adutl_sb_euthanasia

## Background

::: {.callout-note title="Bacterial Inoculum Optimization"}
The bacterial inoculum should be determined empirically for each species used. For many bacteria, 10⁴ Colony Forming Units (CFUs) per milliliter of stickleback medium will suffice for full colonization of the intestine and minimal toxicity to the fish.

**Important considerations**:
-   Dead larvae in the flask will be removed promptly as this will often result in increased bacterial growth that can ultimately be fatal to the remaining larvae.
-   The method below is optimized for several proteobacteria strains.
-   Different bacterial species may require different concentrations (typically ranging from 10³ to 10⁶ CFU/ml).

## Procedure

### Preparation

1.  **Prepare germ-free fish**: Raise fish in a germ-free environment as described in @sec-vert_exp-gremfree_SB.
    -   Fish should be 9-13 days post fertilization (when digestive system is open and fish are feeding).

### Bacterial Culture Preparation

2.  **Bacterial culture**: Incubate bacteria for 16 hours in 50 ml of growth medium in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask at 25°C, 200 RPM.
    -   **Note**: These bacteria should originate from the intestine of a healthy stickleback to ensure that the bacteria are not pathogens (or use well-characterized laboratory strains).

3.  **Measure density**: Measure the Optical Density at 600 nm (OD~600~) of the culture using a spectrophotometer.

4.  **Calculate CFU/ml**: Calculate the original culture density, assuming 1 OD~600~ = 10⁹ CFU/ml.
    -   Note: This conversion factor may vary by bacterial species; verify for your specific strain if possible.

### Monoassociation

5.  **Prepare inoculum**:
    -   Dilute the culture to predetermined concentration (typically 10⁴ CFU/ml) in filter-sterilized stickleback medium.
    -   Work in a tissue culture hood to maintain sterility.
    -   Inoculate the flask containing germ-free larvae.
    -   The fish will be exposed to bacteria in the water after their digestive system is open and they have been shown to consume food (9-13 dpf).

::: {.callout-note title="Concentration Range"}
Germ-free fish water is typically inoculated between 10³ and 10⁶ bacteria per milliliter. Choose a concentration that results in healthy fish surviving to at least three days post-exposure.
:::

6.  **Verify inoculum**: Plate serial dilutions of the original bacterial culture on appropriate agar plates to verify the actual CFU/ml of the inoculum.

### Monitoring

7.  **Daily monitoring**: Monitor fish daily for signs of illness, including:
    -   Lack of motility or response to external stimuli
    -   Rapid or irregular movement of opercular (gill) cover
    -   Changes in swimming behavior
    -   Loss of balance or orientation
    -   Any other signs of abnormal behavior
    -   Remove dead fish immediately

8.  **Water quality**: Every 2-3 days, plate water samples on agar to verify monoassociation (only the introduced bacterial species should be present).

### Termination

9.  **Endpoint**: At the end of the experiment, euthanize fish using established and approved protocols - see @sec-husb-adutl_sb_euthanasia.

10. **Verification**: Dissect fish and plate gut contents to verify colonization and confirm monoassociation status.

## Troubleshooting

::: {.callout-warning title="Common Issues"}
-   **High mortality**: Bacterial concentration may be too high; reduce inoculum in next trial.
-   **No colonization**: Bacterial concentration may be too low or bacteria not viable; verify CFU counts by plating.
-   **Contamination**: If other bacterial species appear, sterile technique was compromised; discard and restart.
-   **Inconsistent colonization**: Ensure fish are at proper developmental stage (digestive system must be open).
