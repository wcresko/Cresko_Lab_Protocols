# Stickleback Salinity Treatment {#sec-vert_exp-salinity_exp_SB}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: Protocols for treating threespine stickleback with salinities that mimic natural freshwater, brackish, and oceanic conditions to study osmoregulatory adaptation and gene expression.
-   **Procedure Type**: Vert Experiment
-   **Species**:
    -   Threespine stickleback, (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*)
-   **Author**: Cresko Laboratory
-   **Date Created**: January 01, 2024

::: {.callout-important title="IACUC Protocol Required"}
This procedure requires an active IACUC protocol covering salinity treatments and environmental manipulations. Ensure all personnel are properly trained in fish husbandry and water quality management.
:::

## Materials

-   Glass containers of fish water of varying salinity ranging from 2-32 ppt
-   Glass 4 L fish containers (use glass, not plastic, due to potential endocrine-disrupting properties of some plastics)
-   Instant Ocean sea salt mix
-   Nanopure or distilled water
-   Water quality test kits (ammonia, nitrite, pH, salinity refractometer)
-   Artemia (brine shrimp) for feeding
-   Thermometer

## Solutions

### Anesthesia and Euthanasia

-   MS-222 Anesthesia solution - see @sec-sb_adult_anesthisia
-   MS-222 Euthanasia solution - see @sec-husb-adutl_sb_euthanasia

### Salinity Solutions

::: {.callout-note title="Instant Ocean Concentrations"}
Different concentrations of Instant Ocean sea salt mix will be used to create three salinity environments that mimic natural conditions where threespine stickleback are found.
:::

**Instant Ocean saltwater mix at the following concentrations:**

-   **2 ppt "Freshwater" environment**: 40 g Instant Ocean per 20 L Nanopure H~2~O
-   **15 ppt "Brackish" environment**: 300 g Instant Ocean per 20 L Nanopure H~2~O
-   **30 ppt "Ocean/Seawater" environment**: 600 g Instant Ocean per 20 L Nanopure H~2~O

## Procedure

### Embryo Collection and Initial Rearing

1.  **Generate embryos**: Follow stickleback crossing and rearing SOP (see @sec-husbandry_stickleback_crossing) to generate 100-200 fertilized embryos.

2.  **Incubate embryos**: Raise fish in incubator until hatching as described in @sec-vert_husbandry_incubator_use.

### Salinity Treatment

3.  **Assign to salinity treatments**: At hatching, move 20 larval fish to each 10.5 L static tank containing the appropriate salinity water (2, 15, or 30 ppt) as prepared above.
    -   Replicate tanks: Set up at least 3 replicate tanks per salinity treatment.
    -   Acclimation: Fish hatched in freshwater can be directly transferred to treatment salinities.

4.  **Initial feeding**: On 9 dpf, begin feeding with freshly hatched artemia (brine shrimp).
    -   Feed enough so that artemia are consumed within 15-30 minutes.

5.  **Daily maintenance**:
    -   Feed and change water every other day.
    -   Check on fish at least twice EVERY DAY.
    -   Use the care checklist to record:
        -   Daily health checks
        -   Feeding
        -   Water changes
    -   Look for signs of sick or stressed fish:
        -   Low rate of opercular (gill) fluttering
        -   Abnormal coloration
        -   Floating upside down or sideways
        -   Lethargy or hyperactivity
        -   Remove dead fish immediately

6.  **Water quality monitoring**:
    -   Check water quality on two random tanks in each treatment once every two days **before** water has been changed.
    -   Test for: ammonia, nitrite, pH, salinity
    -   **If ammonia and/or nitrite are detected**: change water more frequently, check water quality daily, and denote this on checklist.
    -   **Ideal levels**: Ammonia and nitrite should be 0 ppm.

### Sample Collection

7.  **Endpoint**: At designated time of interest (up to 40 days post-fertilization), euthanize fish with MS-222.

8.  **Tissue fixation**: Fix appropriately based on downstream application:
    -   **For RNA**: Liquid nitrogen or RNAlater
    -   **For immunohistochemistry**: 4% PFA
    -   **For histology**: Bouin's fixative

::: {.callout-note title="Anesthesia, N2 Freezing, and Fixation in RNAlater"}
**For RNA preservation**:

1.  Anesthetize using appropriate concentration of MS-222 and allow fish to lay motionless with only slight opercle movement. This should take approximately 10 minutes.

2.  Place fish in liquid N~2~ for 2 minutes. This instantaneously freezes the fish.

3.  Transfer frozen fish to RNAlater-ICE and thaw.

**Alternative for stress-sensitive applications**: If downstream application requires instantaneous, non-stressed measurement of gene transcription, remove fish from water, rapidly blot, and sacrifice directly into liquid nitrogen or RNAlater without anesthesia.

## Data Collection

::: {.callout-tip title="Recommended Measurements"}
-   Growth (length and weight)
-   Survival rates across treatments
-   Gene expression (osmoregulatory genes, stress markers)
-   Morphological measurements (gill surface area, kidney structure)
-   Behavior (activity levels, feeding rates)

## Troubleshooting

::: {.callout-warning title="Common Issues"}
-   **High mortality in high salinity**: May indicate rapid transition; consider gradual acclimation.
-   **Poor water quality**: Increase water change frequency; reduce feeding amounts.
-   **Variable growth**: Ensure consistent feeding and water quality across all tanks.
-   **Salinity drift**: Monitor salinity regularly, especially after water changes; evaporation increases salinity.
