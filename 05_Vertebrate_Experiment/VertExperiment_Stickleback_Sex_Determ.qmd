# Stickleback Sex Determination with PCR {#sec-vert_exp-SB_sex_PCR}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This protocol describes how to determine the genotypic sex of threespine stickleback using PCR amplification of sex-linked markers.
-   **Procedure Type**: Vert Experiment
-   **Species**:
    -   Threespine stickleback, (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*)
-   **Author**: Cresko Laboratory
-   **Date Created**: January 01, 2024
-   **IACUC Approved**: Not applicable (molecular procedure only)
-   **IBC Approved**: Not applicable

::: {.callout-note title="Background"}
Threespine stickleback have an XY sex determination system. The GA1 primers amplify a Y-chromosome specific region (~371 bp) that is present only in males. They also amplify a non-sex-linked control band (~600 bp) present in all individuals, which serves as an internal positive control for the PCR reaction.

## Materials

-   PCR machine/thermocycler
-   2X Turbo mix (or equivalent PCR master mix)
-   GA1 F primer (10 µM concentration)
-   GA1 R primer (10 µM concentration)
-   Taq polymerase
-   Nuclease-free water (npH~2~O)
-   DNA template (extracted from fin clip or tissue)
-   PCR tubes (0.2 ml)
-   Mineral oil (if using non-heated lid thermocycler)
-   2% agarose gel materials
-   DNA ladder (100 bp or similar)

::: {.callout-note title="Other Primer Pairs"}
This procedure also works with GA2 and IDH primers, although PCR parameters may be different. GA1 primers are recommended for standard use.

## Procedure

### DNA Extraction

1.  Extract DNA from fin clip or tissue sample into 250 µl final volume.
    -   Standard DNA extraction protocols can be used (e.g., HotSHOT method, commercial kits).

### PCR Setup

2.  **Prepare PCR master mix** (volumes shown for 1X reaction, scale up as needed):

| Reagent      | Concentration |  Volume  |
|--------------|---------------|:--------:|
| 2X turbo mix |               |   10 µl  |
| GA1 F primer | 10 µM          |  0.25 µl |
| GA1 R primer | 10 µM          |  0.25 µl |
| Taq          |               |  0.25 µl |
| npH~2~O      |               |  7.25 µl |
| DNA          |               |  2.0 µl  |
| **TOTAL**    |               | **20 µl**|

3.  **Add mineral oil** (if needed): After all ingredients are added to a PCR tube, add a 10 µl drop of mineral oil on top.
    -   Note: Only necessary if using a thermocycler without a heated lid.

### PCR Cycling

4.  **Run PCR program**:

| Step              | Temperature | Time       | Cycles |
|-------------------|-------------|------------|--------|
| Initial denaturation | 94°C     | 5 minutes  | 1      |
| Denaturation      | 94°C        | 50 seconds | 44     |
| Annealing         | 44°C        | 50 seconds | 44     |
| Extension         | 72°C        | 1:20 min   | 44     |
| Final extension   | 72°C        | 10 minutes | 1      |
| Hold              | 4°C         | ∞          | --     |

### Gel Electrophoresis

5.  **Prepare 2% agarose gel** in TAE or TBE buffer with ethidium bromide or other DNA stain.

6.  **Load samples**:
    -   Load 5-10 µl of PCR product per well.
    -   Include a DNA ladder (100 bp or similar) for size reference.

7.  **Run gel**: Electrophorese at 100-120V for 30-45 minutes or until adequate separation is achieved.

8.  **Visualize and interpret**:

::: {.callout-tip title="Banding Patterns for Sex Determination"}
The GA1F/R primer pair amplifies:
-   **371 bp band**: Y-chromosome specific, **present only in males (XY)**
-   **600 bp band**: Non-sex-linked control, **present in all fish (XX and XY)**

**Interpretation**:
-   **Male (XY)**: Two bands visible (371 bp bright, 600 bp dim)
-   **Female (XX)**: One band visible (600 bp only)
-   **Failed PCR**: No bands visible

The 600 bp control band helps distinguish a female genotype from a failed PCR reaction. Because of amplification efficiency differences, the 600 bp band will usually be significantly dimmer than the 371 bp band in males.

## Quality Control

::: {.callout-note title="Controls"}
-   **Positive control (male)**: Include a known male sample
-   **Positive control (female)**: Include a known female sample
-   **Negative control**: Include a no-template control (water instead of DNA)

## Troubleshooting

::: {.callout-warning title="Common Issues"}
-   **No bands in any samples**: Check PCR reagents, verify thermocycler program, check DNA quality.
-   **No 371 bp band in known male**: Primers may have degraded; check primer stocks.
-   **Weak 600 bp band**: Normal - this band is typically dimmer; if too weak, increase DNA template amount.
-   **Non-specific bands**: Verify primer sequences, check for contamination, optimize annealing temperature.
