# Production of Haploid Embryos in Stickleback {#sec-vert_exp-haploid_SB}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: This method allows the production of haploid embryos for screening recessive mutations. Haploid embryos develop fairly normally for the first few days, but eventually develop bent tails and vacuolated body cavities. They are inviable and typically die by 7-10 days post fertilization.
-   **Procedure Type**: Vertebrate Experimental
-   **Species**:
    -   Threespine stickleback, (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*)

::: {.callout-important title="IACUC Protocol Required"}
This procedure requires an active IACUC protocol covering UV irradiation of gametes and production of haploid embryos.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Background"}
This is a general procedure for producing UV-inactivated sperm that can still activate eggs but cannot contribute genetic material. The resulting haploid embryos are useful for:
-   Screening for recessive lethal mutations
-   Identifying maternal effect genes
-   Rapid phenotypic screening

The UV treatment damages the sperm DNA, preventing it from participating in development, while leaving the sperm motile enough to activate the egg.

::: {.callout-warning title="Safety - UV Radiation"}
-   UV light can cause severe eye damage and skin burns
-   Always wear safety glasses with UV protection
-   Wear gloves and protective clothing
-   Never look directly at UV lamp
-   Ensure proper ventilation

## Materials

-   Watchglass (sterile)
-   Large glass Petri dish with cover
-   Ice
-   Two Pasteur pipettes (sterile)
-   Pipette bulb
-   Stopwatch
-   UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene) or equivalent UV crosslinker
-   Latex or nitrile gloves
-   UV-protective safety glasses
-   Small test tube with cork, marked "UV sperm"
-   Beaker for ice bath

## Solutions

-   Hank's solution - see @sec-general_recipe_hanks
-   Embryo medium for fertilization - see @sec-general_recipe_embryo_medium

## Procedure

### Preparation

1.  **Prepare ice bath**: Fill the bottom of the glass Petri dish with ice.

2.  **Set up watchglass**: Place watchglass on top of the ice in the dish to keep sperm cool.

### Sperm Transfer and UV Treatment

3.  **Transfer sperm to watchglass**:
    -   Using a clean Pasteur pipette, transfer the sperm from the collection tube onto the chilled watchglass.
    -   Get as much of the sperm into the pipette as possible without taking up any air bubbles.
    -   Do NOT bubble the sperm as you expel them from the pipette.
    -   Expel sperm in a thin, even layer on the watchglass for uniform UV exposure.

::: {.callout-warning title="Important"}
DISCARD THIS PIPETTE after use - do not reuse for collecting UV-treated sperm.
:::

4.  **Cover sperm**: Place the cover on the Petri dish to protect from contamination during setup.

5.  **Prepare for UV exposure**:
    -   Put on latex/nitrile gloves
    -   Put on UV-protective safety glasses

6.  **Position under UV lamp**: Place the covered Petri dish under the UV Stratalinker.

7.  **UV treatment**:
    -   Remove the cover from the Petri dish
    -   Start the stopwatch immediately
    -   Gently move the dish under the lamp in a swirling motion for **two minutes**
    -   This ensures even UV exposure across all sperm

8.  **Complete UV treatment**:
    -   After exactly two minutes of UV exposure, replace the cover on the Petri dish
    -   Remove the dish from under the UV lamp

### Collection and Storage

9.  **Collect UV-treated sperm**:
    -   Using a CLEAN (new) Pasteur pipette, remove the UV-treated sperm from the watchglass
    -   Transfer sperm to the small test tube marked "UV sperm"

10. **Store on ice**: Place the UV sperm test tube into an ice bath until ready to fertilize eggs.

### Fertilization

11. **Use for fertilization**: Use UV-treated sperm to fertilize eggs according to standard stickleback crossing protocols (see @sec-husbandry_stickleback_crossing).
    -   Haploid embryos should be monitored for viability
    -   Expect higher mortality than normal diploid embryos
    -   Screen for phenotypes of interest before embryos become inviable (typically by 7 dpf)

## Quality Control

::: {.callout-tip title="Verifying UV Treatment Success"}
-   Control fertilization: Fertilize a small batch of eggs with untreated sperm as a positive control
-   Test batch: Fertilize eggs with UV-treated sperm; lack of cleavage or abnormal development indicates successful UV treatment
-   If normal development occurs, sperm DNA was not sufficiently inactivated; increase UV exposure time

## Troubleshooting

::: {.callout-warning title="Common Issues"}
-   **Normal diploid development**: UV exposure was insufficient; increase exposure time in 30-second increments
-   **No activation of eggs**: UV exposure was too long or sperm were damaged; reduce UV exposure time
-   **Poor sperm motility after UV**: Sperm may have been too warm during treatment; ensure watchglass is well-chilled
