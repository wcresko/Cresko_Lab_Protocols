# Storage of Stickleback Eggs {#sec-vert_exp-egg_storage_SB}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: Storage of unfertilized stickleback eggs for fertilization up to 24 hours post-stripping. This protocol allows for temporal separation of egg collection and fertilization, facilitating experimental design and cross logistics.
-   **Procedure Type**: Vertebrate Experimental
-   **Species**:
    -   Threespine stickleback, (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*)
-   **Author**: Mark Currey

::: {.callout-important title="IACUC Protocol Required"}
This procedure requires an active IACUC protocol covering egg stripping and fertilization procedures.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Background"}
Unfertilized stickleback eggs can be stored in a specialized storage medium containing antibiotics to prevent bacterial growth. This allows eggs to be:
-   Transported between facilities
-   Collected and fertilized at different times
-   Stored while preparing sperm or other materials

Storage on ice extends egg viability up to 24 hours, with best results when fertilized within 12 hours.

## Materials

-   Streptomycin & Penicillin Solution (PenStrep) from Sigma (P-0906) - 100% stock
-   50 ml sterile polypropylene conical tubes
-   90 mm petri dishes (sterile)
-   Ice bucket or cooler with ice
-   Transfer pipettes

## Solutions

-   **Holtfreter's Solution** - see @sec-general_recipe_holtfrieters
-   **Embryo medium** - see @sec-general_recipe_embryo_medium
-   **Egg storage solution** (prepare fresh for each use):
    -   Add PenStrep to Holtfreter's solution for a final concentration of 1%
    -   (10 ml PenStrep stock into 1 liter Holtfreter's solution)
    -   Keep chilled at 4°C

## Procedure

### Egg Collection and Storage

1.  **Prepare egg storage solution**:
    -   Add 10 ml of PenStrep stock to 1 liter of Holtfreter's solution (1% final concentration)
    -   Chill on ice

2.  **Collect eggs**:
    -   Strip eggs from ripe female into a 50 ml conical tube containing 25 ml of cold egg storage solution
    -   Work quickly to minimize time eggs are unfertilized

3.  **Store eggs**:
    -   Cap the tube tightly
    -   Store on ice (or at 4°C)

::: {.callout-tip title="Storage Duration"}
Eggs can be transported on ice and fertilized up to 24 hours later. However, fertilization success is highest when eggs are used within 12 hours of collection.

### Fertilization of Stored Eggs

4.  **Equilibrate temperature**:
    -   Transfer eggs to a 90 mm petri dish
    -   Allow temperature to equilibrate to 20°C (room temperature)
    -   This takes approximately 15-20 minutes

5.  **Prepare for fertilization**:
    -   Remove egg storage solution from petri dish
    -   Rinse eggs once with fresh embryo medium
    -   **Important**: This rinse lowers the salt concentration, which is essential for optimal sperm activation

6.  **Fertilize**:
    -   Add macerated testis preparation as usual (see @sec-husbandry_stickleback_crossing)
    -   Cover eggs with embryo medium
    -   Allow fertilization to proceed for 1-2 minutes
    -   Add additional embryo medium to dilute sperm

7.  **Incubate**: Transfer fertilized eggs to incubator at 20°C for development.

## Quality Control

::: {.callout-note title="Monitoring Fertilization Success"}
-   Check fertilization rates after 2-4 hours (look for cell division)
-   Compare to fresh (non-stored) egg controls
-   Expected fertilization rates may be slightly lower than fresh eggs, especially after 12+ hours storage
-   Document storage time and fertilization success for optimization

## Troubleshooting

::: {.callout-warning title="Common Issues"}
-   **Low fertilization rates**: Eggs may have been stored too long; try to fertilize within 12 hours. Check that eggs were kept cold throughout storage.
-   **Bacterial contamination**: Ensure egg storage solution contains fresh antibiotics and all materials are sterile.
-   **Poor egg quality**: Female may not have been fully ripe; ensure proper conditioning and timing of egg stripping.
-   **Sperm not activated**: Ensure thorough rinse with embryo medium to remove high salt from storage solution.
