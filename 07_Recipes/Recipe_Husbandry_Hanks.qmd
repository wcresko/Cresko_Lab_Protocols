## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: Recipe for Hank's balanced salt solution, a physiological buffer used for cell and tissue culture
-   **Procedure Type**: recipe
-   **Species**:
    -   Threespine stickleback, (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*)

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
This protocol uses a stock solution system. Prepare all stock solutions first, then make the premix, and finally prepare the working solution fresh as needed.

## Materials

-   NaCl (sodium chloride)
-   KCl (potassium chloride)
-   CaCl2 (calcium chloride)
-   MgSO4·7H2O (magnesium sulfate heptahydrate)
-   Na2HPO4 anhydrous (sodium phosphate dibasic)
-   KH2PO4 (potassium phosphate monobasic)
-   NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate)
-   Distilled deionized water (ddH2O)
-   Analytical balance
-   Graduated cylinders
-   Glass bottles for stock storage
-   Stir bars and stir plate

::: {.callout-caution title="Safety"}
**PPE Required**: Lab coat, safety glasses, and gloves when handling chemicals.

## Solutions

### Hank's Stock Solutions

Prepare the following stock solutions:

**Stock #1:**
- 8.0 g NaCl
- 0.4 g KCl
- Dissolve in ddH2O and bring to 100 ml total volume

**Stock #2:**
- 0.358 g Na2HPO4 (anhydrous)
- 0.60 g KH2PO4
- Dissolve in ddH2O and bring to 100 ml total volume

**Stock #4:**
- 0.72 g CaCl2
- Dissolve in ddH2O and bring to 50 ml total volume

**Stock #5:**
- 1.23 g MgSO4·7H2O
- Dissolve in ddH2O and bring to 50 ml total volume

**Stock #6:**
- 0.35 g NaHCO3
- Dissolve in ddH2O and bring to 10.0 ml total volume

### Hank's Premix

Combine the following stock solutions in order:
- 10.0 ml Stock #1
- 1.0 ml Stock #2
- 1.0 ml Stock #4
- 86.0 ml ddH2O
- 1.0 ml Stock #5

Total volume: 99 ml

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
Store Hank's Premix in the refrigerator (4°C) along with the stock solutions.

## Procedure

### To prepare final working Hank's solution (10 ml):

1. Add 9.9 ml Hank's Premix to a clean container
2. Add 0.1 ml Stock #6 (NaHCO3)
3. Mix thoroughly by swirling or gentle inversion
4. Use immediately or store at 4°C for short-term use

### To scale for different volumes:

- For each 1 ml final volume: use 0.99 ml Premix + 0.01 ml Stock #6
- For 50 ml: use 49.5 ml Premix + 0.5 ml Stock #6
- For 100 ml: use 99 ml Premix + 1 ml Stock #6

## Storage

**Stock Solutions:**
-   **Temperature**: 4°C (refrigerator)
-   **Duration**: Stable for 2-3 months
-   **Container**: Glass bottles with tight-sealing lids
-   **Label**: Mark each stock with number, contents, date prepared

**Hank's Premix:**
-   **Temperature**: 4°C (refrigerator)
-   **Duration**: Stable for 2-3 months
-   **Container**: Glass bottle with tight-sealing lid
-   **Label**: Mark as "Hank's Premix" with date prepared

**Final Hank's Solution:**
-   **Temperature**: 4°C (refrigerator) or use immediately
-   **Duration**: Use within 1-2 weeks
-   **Container**: Sterile bottle if needed for cell culture

## Quality Control

-   **pH**: Final solution should be approximately 7.2-7.4
-   **Appearance**: All solutions should be clear and colorless
-   **Sterility**: For cell/tissue culture, filter-sterilize (0.22 μm) or autoclave stocks before use
-   **Verification**: Check for precipitates before use; discard if cloudy

::: {.callout-tip title="Usage Notes"}
- Stock #6 (NaHCO3) is added last because it provides CO2 buffering
- For best results, prepare final working solution fresh from premix
- Solution can be warmed to room temperature or 37°C before use
- Adjust pH if needed for specific applications
