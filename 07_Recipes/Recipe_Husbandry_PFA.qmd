# 8% Paraformaldehyde Stock Solution {#sec-recipe-PFA}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: Recipe for 8% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) Stock Solution used for tissue fixation in immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization
-   **Procedure Type**: recipe
-   **Species**:
    -   Threespine stickleback, (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*)
    -   Bay pipefish, (*Syngnathus leptorhyncus*)
    -   Gulf pipefish (*Syngnathus scovelli*)

::: {.callout-warning title="Safety Warning"}
**CRITICAL**: This procedure must be performed in a chemical fume hood at all times.

**Chemical Hazards**: Paraformaldehyde is highly toxic, carcinogenic, and a severe irritant. Powder and vapors are extremely dangerous.

**Required PPE**:
- Double nitrile gloves
- Safety goggles or face shield
- Lab coat
- Work entirely in fume hood

**Acute Exposure Risks**:
- Inhalation: Severe respiratory irritation, potential lung damage
- Skin contact: Burns and sensitization
- Eye contact: Severe damage, potential blindness
- Ingestion: Potentially fatal

**Disposal**: PFA waste must be disposed of as hazardous chemical waste. Never pour down drain. Follow institutional chemical waste disposal procedures.

## Materials

-   Paraformaldehyde powder (located in chemical cabinet)
-   Distilled water
-   Hot plate with magnetic stirrer
-   Magnetic stir bar
-   pH meter
-   Thermometer
-   0.45 μm or 0.2 μm filter apparatus
-   Cryogenic vials or tubes for aliquoting
-   Graduated cylinders

## Solutions

-   10 N NaOH
-   20% HCl

## Procedure

::: {.callout-warning title="Critical Warning"}
**USE A FUME HOOD FOR THE ENTIRE PROCEDURE!**

All steps must be performed with adequate ventilation. Never remove containers from fume hood until sealed.
:::

1.  In fume hood, add 40 g paraformaldehyde powder to 450 ml distilled water in a glass beaker (or scale for desired final volume)

2.  Add 1 μl of 10 N NaOH per ml of water (i.e., 500 μl for 500 ml total volume)

3.  Place beaker on hot plate with stir bar and apply medium heat while stirring at medium speed
    - Heat for approximately 15-20 minutes
    - Monitor temperature - solution must not exceed 60°C
    - Granules will gradually dissolve and solution will become translucent

::: {.callout-warning title="Critical Warning"}
**DO NOT LET THE SOLUTION STIR BEYOND THIS POINT** - over-stirring will form a fuzzy precipitate that reduces the solution strength after filtering. Stop immediately when solution clears.
:::

4.  Once granules have completely dissolved and solution is clear, turn off heat

5.  Allow to cool slightly, then equilibrate to pH 7.4 using approximately 1.5 ml of 20% HCl
    - Add HCl slowly while monitoring pH
    - Scale HCl volume depending on final target volume
    - Bring final volume to 500 ml (or scaled volume) with distilled water

6.  Filter while still warm through 0.45 μm filter (or 0.2 μm for extra purity)
    - Filtering while warm improves flow rate
    - Use vacuum filtration apparatus in fume hood

7.  Aliquot into labeled cryogenic vials or tubes
    - Typical aliquot size: 1-5 ml
    - Label clearly with "8% PFA", date, and hazard warnings

## Storage

-   **Temperature**: -20°C (freezer)
-   **Duration**: Stable for 6-12 months when frozen
-   **Container**: Cryogenic vials or sealed tubes that can withstand freezing
-   **Label**: Must include "8% PFA", "TOXIC", date prepared, and expiration date
-   **Thawing**: Thaw aliquots in fume hood or well-ventilated area

## Quality Control

-   **pH**: Must be 7.4 ± 0.1 for optimal fixation
-   **Appearance**: Solution should be clear and colorless
-   **Concentration verification**: Can be verified by refractive index or other analytical methods
-   **Discard if**: Solution is cloudy, has precipitate, or has been frozen/thawed more than 3 times

::: {.callout-tip title="Usage Notes"}
- For 4% PFA working solution, dilute 8% stock 1:1 with 2x PBS
- Always work with PFA in fume hood, even when using working solutions
- Warm aliquots to room temperature before opening to prevent condensation
- Do not refreeze thawed aliquots multiple times
