**Chemical Hazards**: Formalin (formaldehyde solution) is toxic, carcinogenic, and irritating to skin, eyes, and respiratory system. Glacial acetic acid is corrosive and causes severe burns.

**Required PPE**:
- Nitrile gloves (double-gloving recommended)
- Safety glasses or goggles
- Lab coat
- Work in a fume hood

**Disposal**: Formalin-containing waste must be disposed of as hazardous chemical waste. Label container clearly and follow institutional chemical waste disposal procedures.

## Materials

-   Ethanol (95%)
-   Formalin (Formaldehyde 37% solution, histological grade, contains 10-15% methanol, Sigma # F1635)
-   Glacial Acetic Acid
-   Distilled Water

## Procedure

1.  Prepare Dietrich's Fixative (100 ml) in a fume hood by mixing:
    - 30 ml Ethanol (95%)
    - 10 ml Formalin (Formaldehyde 37% solution, histological grade, contains 10-15% methanol, Sigma # F1635)
    - 2 ml Glacial Acetic Acid
    - 58 ml Distilled Water

2.  Mix thoroughly and transfer to a labeled, sealed container.

## Storage

-   **Temperature**: Room temperature
-   **Duration**: Stable for several months when properly sealed
-   **Container**: Glass bottle with tight-sealing lid, stored in chemical cabinet or fume hood
-   **Label**: Clearly mark as "Dietrich's Fixative" with date prepared and hazard warnings

## Quality Control

-   Solution should be clear and colorless
-   Discard if solution becomes cloudy or develops precipitate
-   Strong formaldehyde odor is normal
