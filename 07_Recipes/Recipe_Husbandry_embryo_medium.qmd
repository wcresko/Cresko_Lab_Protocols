# Stickleback Embryo Medium (EM) {#sec-recipe-em}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: Recipe for embryo medium used in stickleback embryo culture and rearing
-   **Procedure Type**: recipe
-   **Species**:
    -   Threespine stickleback, (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*)
-   **Author**: Mark Currey
-   **Date Created**: January 1, 2004

## Materials

-   Instant Ocean Salt
-   Baking Soda (sodium bicarbonate)
-   Nanopure water (npH2O)
-   2 liter glass flasks
-   pH meter or pH strips
-   Analytical balance
-   Weigh boats or paper

## Procedure

For 2 liters:

1. Add 8 g Instant Ocean Salt to 2 liters of npH2O
2. Add approximately 0.5 g baking soda
3. Mix thoroughly until all solids are dissolved
4. Check pH and adjust to 7.0 - 8.0
   - If pH is too low, add small amounts of baking soda
   - If pH is too high, allow to equilibrate or prepare fresh solution

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
Salt and baking soda are located in containers near the weigh station. Rinse 2 liter flasks with DI water between uses.

## Storage

-   **Temperature**: Room temperature
-   **Duration**: Use within 1-2 weeks; prepare fresh for optimal embryo health
-   **Container**: Clean, sterile 2 liter glass flasks
-   **Label**: Mark with "Embryo Medium", date prepared, and pH value

## Quality Control

-   **pH**: Must be between 7.0 - 8.0 for optimal embryo development
-   **Appearance**: Solution should be clear and free of particulates
-   **Conductivity**: Should be approximately 4-6 mS/cm (similar to natural freshwater conditions)
-   **Verification**: Check pH before each use; discard if pH has drifted outside acceptable range

::: {.callout-tip title="Best Practices"}
- Prepare fresh embryo medium weekly for best results
- Always rinse flasks thoroughly with DI water between batches
- Allow solution to equilibrate to room temperature before adding embryos
