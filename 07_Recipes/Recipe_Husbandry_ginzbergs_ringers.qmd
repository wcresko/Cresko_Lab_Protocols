## Materials

-   NaCl (sodium chloride)
-   KCl (potassium chloride)
-   CaCl2 (calcium chloride)
-   NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate)
-   Nanopure water (npH2O)
-   1 liter glass bottle or flask
-   Analytical balance
-   Weigh boats or paper
-   Stir bar and stir plate

## Procedure

For 1000 ml:

1. Add 750 ml of npH2O to a clean 1 liter glass bottle
2. Add the following reagents while stirring:
   - 6.6 g NaCl
   - 0.25 g KCl
   - 0.3 g CaCl2
   - 0.2 g NaHCO3
3. Stir until all solids are completely dissolved
4. Bring to 1 liter total volume with npH2O
5. Mix thoroughly and transfer to labeled storage bottle

## Storage

-   **Temperature**: 4°C (refrigerator)
-   **Duration**: Stable for 2-3 months when stored properly
-   **Container**: Clean glass bottle with tight-sealing lid
-   **Label**: Mark with "Ginzberg's Ringer Solution", date prepared, and storage temperature

## Quality Control

-   **Appearance**: Solution should be clear and colorless
-   **pH**: Should be approximately 7.2-7.6
-   **Verification**: Check for clarity before each use; discard if cloudy or contaminated
-   **Sterility**: For long-term storage, solution can be filter-sterilized (0.22 μm) or autoclaved
