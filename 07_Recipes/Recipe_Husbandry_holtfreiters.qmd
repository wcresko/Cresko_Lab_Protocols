-   **Species**:
    -   Threespine stickleback, (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*)
    -   Bay pipefish, (*Syngnathus leptorhyncus*)

## Materials

-   NaCl (sodium chloride)
-   KCl (potassium chloride)
-   CaCl2 (calcium chloride)
-   NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate)
-   Tris buffer (1 M, pH 7.4-8.0)
-   Nanopure water (npH2O)
-   1 liter glass bottle or flask
-   Analytical balance
-   Weigh boats or paper
-   Graduated cylinders
-   Stir bar and stir plate
-   pH meter or pH strips

::: {.callout-caution title="Safety"}
**PPE Required**: Lab coat, safety glasses, and gloves when handling chemicals.

**Handling**: Calcium chloride is hygroscopic and can cause skin and eye irritation. Handle in well-ventilated area.

## Procedure

For 1 liter stock solution:

1. Add 750 ml of npH2O to a clean 1 liter glass bottle

2. Add the following reagents while stirring:
   - 3.5 g NaCl
   - 0.05 g KCl
   - 0.1 g CaCl2
   - 0.02 g NaHCO3

3. Stir until all solids are completely dissolved

4. Add 1.0 ml Tris buffer (1 M)

5. Bring to 1 liter total volume with npH2O

6. Mix thoroughly and check pH (should be approximately 7.4-7.8)

7. Transfer to labeled storage bottle

Store at 4°C. This solution is similar to @sec-recipe-ginzbergs_ringers but optimized for embryological work.
:::

## Storage

-   **Temperature**: 4°C (refrigerator)
-   **Duration**: Stable for 2-3 months when stored properly
-   **Container**: Clean glass bottle with tight-sealing lid
-   **Label**: Mark with "Holtfreiter's Solution", date prepared, and storage temperature

## Quality Control

-   **Appearance**: Solution should be clear and colorless
-   **pH**: Should be approximately 7.4-7.8 (verify with pH meter)
-   **Verification**: Check for clarity before each use; discard if cloudy or contaminated
-   **Sterility**: For embryological work, solution can be filter-sterilized (0.22 μm) or autoclaved if needed

::: {.callout-tip title="Usage Notes"}
- Allow solution to warm to room temperature before use with embryos
- Can be used for embryo rearing, tissue dissection, and other physiological procedures
- Solution composition provides balanced osmolarity for developing embryos
- For dilute Holtfreiter's (often used in embryo studies), dilute stock 1:10 with npH2O
