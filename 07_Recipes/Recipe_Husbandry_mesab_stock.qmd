# Mesab Stock Solution {#sec-recipe-mesab}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: Recipe for making a mesab (tricaine) stock solution used for fish anesthesia
-   **Procedure Type**: recipe
-   **Species**:
    -   Threespine stickleback, (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*)
    -   Bay pipefish, (*Syngnathus leptorhyncus*)
    -   Gulf pipefish (*Syngnathus scovelli*)

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
Mesab also known as Tricaine must be pharmaceutical-grade. We use tricaine purchased from Pentair, manufactured by Western Chemical and FDA approved. Tricaine (3-amino benzoic acid ethyl ester also called ethyl m-aminobenzoate) comes in a powdered form. Purchase the smallest amount possible because tricaine expires quickly.

::: {.callout-warning title="Safety Warning"}
**Chemical Hazards**: Tricaine (MS-222) can cause skin and respiratory irritation. Avoid breathing powder or mist.

**Required PPE**:
- Nitrile gloves
- Safety glasses
- Lab coat
- Dust mask when handling powder

**Handling**: Work in well-ventilated area. Wash hands thoroughly after handling.

**Disposal**: Follow institutional guidelines for pharmaceutical waste disposal.

## Materials

-   Mesab powder (MS-222, tricaine, or 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester) - pharmaceutical grade
-   1 M Tris (pH 9)
-   Distilled deionized (DD) water
-   pH meter or pH strips
-   Analytical balance
-   1 liter graduated cylinder or volumetric flask
-   50 ml conical tubes for aliquoting
-   Stir bar and stir plate

## Procedure

For 1 liter stock solution (4 g/L):

1. Weigh 4 g tricaine powder and add to a clean 1 liter container
2. Add 979 ml DD water
3. Stir to dissolve powder completely
4. Add approximately 21 ml of 1 M Tris (pH 9)
5. Check pH and adjust to pH 7.0 using additional Tris solution
6. Mix thoroughly to ensure complete dissolution and pH equilibration
7. Aliquot into 50 ml conical tubes
8. Label each tube with "MESAB Stock Solution 4 g/L", date prepared, and expiration date

## Storage

-   **Temperature**: -20°C (freezer)
-   **Duration**: 3-6 months; tricaine degrades over time
-   **Container**: 50 ml conical tubes with tight-sealing caps
-   **Label**: Include concentration (4 g/L), date prepared, and expiration date
-   **Expiration**: Note that tricaine powder expires quickly; check manufacturer's expiration date

## Quality Control

-   **pH**: Must be pH 7.0 for safe use in fish
-   **Appearance**: Solution should be clear and colorless to pale yellow
-   **Efficacy**: If fish take longer than normal to become anesthetized, solution may be degraded
-   **Storage check**: Discard if solution has developed precipitate or unusual odor

::: {.callout-tip title="Usage Notes"}
- Stock solution (4 g/L) must be diluted before use with fish
- Typical working concentration is 1:10 to 1:20 dilution (200-400 mg/L)
- Always buffer to pH 7.0 before use
- Thaw aliquots at room temperature before use
- Do not refreeze thawed aliquots
