# Testes Storage Solution {#sec-recipe-testes_solution}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: Recipe for making testes storage solution with antibiotics for preserving dissected testes and sperm
-   **Procedure Type**: recipe
-   **Species**:
    -   Threespine stickleback, (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*)
-   **Author**: Mark Currey
-   **Date Created**: January 1, 2004

## Materials

-   Gentamycin (antimycotic) stock - 10 mg/ml
-   Cell Culture antibiotic/antimycotic from Gibco-BRL (catalog #15240-096), 100x concentration
-   Micropipettes (100 μl)
-   Sterile pipette tips
-   Sterile containers for storage

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
Both of these reagents are located in separate boxes in the scientific -20°C freezer. They are partitioned into 100 μl aliquots.

::: {.callout-caution title="Safety"}
**PPE Required**: Gloves and lab coat when handling antibiotics.

**Sterile Technique**: Use aseptic technique when preparing solution to prevent contamination.

## Solutions

-   @sec-recipe-ginzbergs_ringers (Ginzberg's Ringer Solution) - 100 ml

## Procedure

For 100 ml:

1. Thaw one 100 μl aliquot of Gentamycin (10 mg/ml) and one 100 μl aliquot of antibiotic/antimycotic (100x) at room temperature
2. Prepare 100 ml of Ginzberg's Ringer Solution (see @sec-recipe-ginzbergs_ringers)
3. Add 100 μl of Gentamycin to the Ginzberg's Ringer solution
4. Add 100 μl of antibiotic/antimycotic to the Ginzberg's Ringer solution
5. Mix thoroughly by swirling or gentle inversion
6. Transfer to a sterile, labeled container

## Storage

-   **Temperature**: 4°C (refrigerator)
-   **Duration**: Use within 1-2 weeks; prepare fresh for best results
-   **Container**: Sterile glass or plastic bottle with tight-sealing lid
-   **Label**: Mark with "Testes Storage Solution", date prepared, and expiration date

## Quality Control

-   **Appearance**: Solution should be clear and colorless
-   **Sterility**: If cloudiness or contamination appears, discard immediately
-   **Effectiveness**: Testes/sperm should remain viable for several hours when kept on ice in this solution

::: {.callout-tip title="Usage Notes"}
- Keep solution on ice during testes dissections
- Use sterile instruments to prevent contamination
- Solution helps preserve sperm viability and prevent bacterial growth
- Typically used during breeding season for in vitro fertilization procedures
