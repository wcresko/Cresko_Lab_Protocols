# 2x SSC, 0.2% Tween-20 {#sec-recipe-tween20}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: Recipe for making 50 ml of 2x SSC, 0.2% Tween-20 wash buffer used in in situ hybridization protocols
-   **Procedure Type**: Recipe
-   **Author**: Micah Woods
-   **Date Created**: March 5, 2024

## Solutions

-   20x SSC (5 ml)
    -   Purchase pre-made from Chem Stores
    -   SSC = Saline-Sodium Citrate buffer
-   Tween-20 (100 μl)
    -   Located in the chemical cabinet on the "Oxidizers A-Z" shelf
    -   Non-ionic detergent
-   Nanopure water (45 ml)
    -   Located in the Nalgene at the north sink

## Materials

-   50 ml Falcon tube
-   Pipettes (1-5 ml and 100-200 μl)
-   Pipette tips
-   Graduated cylinder (optional)

::: {.callout-tip title="Scaling"}
This recipe can be scaled proportionally:
- For 100 ml: 10 ml 20x SSC + 200 μl Tween-20 + 90 ml water
- For 200 ml: 20 ml 20x SSC + 400 μl Tween-20 + 180 ml water

## Procedure

1.  Add 5 ml of 20x SSC to a clean 50 ml Falcon tube

2.  Add 100 μl of Tween-20 to the tube

    ::: {.callout-important title="Note"}
    Tween-20 is a very viscous solution, which can make it challenging to pipet. Push the pipette to the first stop, place the pipette tip in the Tween-20, and wait at least 10 seconds for the Tween-20 to fill the pipette tip. Due to its high viscosity, the Tween-20 will take longer to fill the pipette tip compared to less viscous liquids. Once the pipette tip is full, slowly dispense the Tween-20 into the tube.

3.  Fill tube to 50 ml mark with nanopure water (approximately 45 ml)

4.  Cap tube and mix thoroughly by inverting 10-15 times until solution is homogeneous

## Storage

-   **Temperature**: Room temperature
-   **Duration**: Stable for 2-3 months at room temperature
-   **Container**: 50 ml Falcon tube or glass bottle with tight-sealing cap
-   **Label**: Mark with "2x SSC, 0.2% Tween-20", date prepared, and room temperature storage

## Quality Control

-   **Appearance**: Solution should be clear and slightly viscous
-   **Homogeneity**: Should be well-mixed with no visible Tween-20 droplets
-   **pH**: Should be approximately 7.0 (inherited from SSC buffer)
-   **Verification**: Check that solution mixes evenly and shows no phase separation

::: {.callout-note title="Usage Notes"}
- Used as a wash buffer in in situ hybridization protocols
- Tween-20 reduces non-specific binding and surface tension
- Always mix well before use as Tween-20 may settle slightly over time
- Compatible with most nucleic acid hybridization procedures
