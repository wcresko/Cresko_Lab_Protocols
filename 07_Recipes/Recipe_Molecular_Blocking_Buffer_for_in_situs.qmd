# Blocking Buffer for in situ Hybridizations {#sec-recipe-blocking_buffer}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: Recipe for making 10 ml of blocking buffer for in situ hybridizations to reduce non-specific antibody binding
-   **Procedure Type**: Recipe
-   **Author**: Micah Woods
-   **Date Created**: March 5, 2024

## Solutions

-   Goat or sheep serum (200 μl) - 2% final concentration
    -   Located in the "Pistol Frog Pond" freezer in 1.5 ml aliquots
    -   Heat-inactivated serum preferred
-   BSA (0.02 g) - 0.2% final concentration
    -   Bovine Serum Albumin, powder form
    -   Located in the "Cruella Cooper" fridge in a white bottle with a red lid
-   @sec-recipe-pbt (10 ml)
    -   Phosphate Buffered Saline with Tween-20

## Materials

-   15 ml plastic Falcon tube
-   Pipettes (200 μl and 1-10 ml)
-   Pipette tips
-   Analytical balance
-   Weigh paper or weigh boat

::: {.callout-note title="Note"}
Prepare fresh blocking buffer on the day of use for best results. For large-scale experiments, can be prepared the day before and stored at 4°C.

## Procedure

1.  Remove one aliquot of goat or sheep serum from freezer and thaw at room temperature
    - Once melted and warmed to room temperature, flick the tube to mix and ensure the serum is homogenized

2.  Add 200 μl of the goat or sheep serum to a clean 15 ml Falcon tube

3.  Weigh 0.02 g of BSA powder using the analytical balance
    - Use clean weigh paper or weigh boat
    - Add the 0.02 g of BSA to the tube with serum

4.  Fill tube to 10 ml mark with PBT (see @sec-recipe-pbt)

5.  Cap tube and mix thoroughly by inverting 15-20 times until BSA is completely dissolved
    - May take several minutes for BSA to fully dissolve
    - Can gently vortex if needed to speed dissolution

6.  Check that solution is homogeneous with no visible BSA particles

## Storage

-   **Temperature**: 4°C (refrigerator)
-   **Duration**: Use within 24 hours for best results; maximum 2-3 days
-   **Container**: 15 ml Falcon tube with cap tightly sealed
-   **Label**: Mark with "Blocking Buffer", date prepared, and expiration date

## Quality Control

-   **Appearance**: Solution should be clear to slightly opalescent
-   **Protein dissolution**: No visible BSA particles should remain
-   **Contamination check**: Discard if solution becomes cloudy or shows signs of bacterial growth
-   **Efficacy**: Effective blocking reduces background staining in in situ hybridization

::: {.callout-tip title="Usage Notes"}
- Blocking buffer is used to pre-treat tissues before antibody incubation
- Serum source (goat vs sheep) should match the host species of secondary antibody when possible
- BSA provides additional protein to block non-specific binding sites
- Typical blocking time is 1-2 hours at room temperature or 4°C
- Can be scaled proportionally for larger or smaller volumes

::: {.callout-caution title="Protein Handling"}
**Gentle handling**: Avoid creating foam when mixing (proteins can denature at air-water interface)

**Temperature**: Keep cold when not in use to prevent bacterial growth and protein degradation
