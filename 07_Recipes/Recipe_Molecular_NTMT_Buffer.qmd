# NTMT Buffer {#sec-recipe-NTMT}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: Recipe for making 25 ml of NTMT buffer (NaCl-Tris-MgCl2-Tween) used in alkaline phosphatase detection reactions for in situ hybridization
-   **Procedure Type**: Recipe
-   **Author**: Micah Woods
-   **Date Created**: March 5, 2024

## Solutions

-   5 M NaCl (0.5 ml)
    -   Purchase pre-made from Chem Stores
    -   Final concentration: 100 mM
-   1 M MgCl2 (1.25 ml)
    -   Purchase pre-made from Chem Stores
    -   Final concentration: 50 mM
-   1 M Tris pH 9.5 (2.5 ml)
    -   Purchase pre-made from Chem Stores
    -   Final concentration: 100 mM
    -   High pH is critical for alkaline phosphatase activity
-   20% Tween-20 (62.5 μl)
    -   Located in the chemical cabinet on the "Oxidizers A-Z" shelf
    -   Final concentration: 0.05%
-   Nanopure water (to 25 ml)
    -   Located in the Nalgene at the north sink

## Materials

-   50 ml Falcon tube (or 25 ml tube)
-   Pipettes (100 μl, 1 ml, and 5 ml)
-   Pipette tips
-   Graduated cylinder (optional)

::: {.callout-tip title="Scaling"}
This recipe can be scaled proportionally:
- For 50 ml: 1.0 ml 5M NaCl + 2.5 ml 1M MgCl2 + 5.0 ml 1M Tris + 125 μl 20% Tween-20 + water to 50 ml
- For 100 ml: 2.0 ml 5M NaCl + 5.0 ml 1M MgCl2 + 10.0 ml 1M Tris + 250 μl 20% Tween-20 + water to 100 ml
:::

## Procedure

1.  Add 0.5 ml of 5 M NaCl to a clean 50 ml Falcon tube

2.  Add 1.25 ml of 1 M MgCl2 to the tube

3.  Add 2.5 ml of 1 M Tris pH 9.5 to the tube

4.  Add 62.5 μl of 20% Tween-20 to the tube

    ::: {.callout-important title="Note"}
    Tween-20 is a very viscous solution, which can make it challenging to pipet. Push the pipette to the first stop, place the pipette tip in the Tween-20, and wait at least 10 seconds for the Tween-20 to fill the pipette tip. Due to its high viscosity, the Tween-20 will take longer to fill the pipette tip compared to less viscous liquids. Once the pipette tip is full, slowly dispense the Tween-20 into the tube.

5.  Fill tube to 25 ml mark with nanopure water (approximately 20.7 ml)

6.  Cap tube and mix thoroughly by inverting 10-15 times until solution is homogeneous

## Storage

-   **Temperature**: Room temperature or 4°C
-   **Duration**: Stable for 2-3 months at room temperature; 3-6 months at 4°C
-   **Container**: 50 ml Falcon tube or glass bottle with tight-sealing cap
-   **Label**: Mark with "NTMT Buffer", date prepared, and storage conditions

## Quality Control

-   **pH**: Should be 9.5 ± 0.1 (critical for alkaline phosphatase activity)
-   **Appearance**: Solution should be clear and colorless
-   **Verification**: Verify pH with pH meter if critical application
-   **Efficacy**: Proper NTMT buffer should support strong alkaline phosphatase color development

::: {.callout-caution title="pH Critical"}
**Important**: The pH 9.5 is essential for optimal alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity. Do not substitute with Tris at different pH. If pH drifts below 9.3, prepare fresh buffer.

::: {.callout-tip title="Usage Notes"}
- NTMT buffer is used immediately before alkaline phosphatase color development reaction
- Provides optimal pH and salt conditions for NBT/BCIP or other AP substrates
- Mg2+ is a required cofactor for alkaline phosphatase activity
- Tween-20 reduces background and surface tension
- Equilibrate to room temperature before use
- Used after antibody detection steps in in situ hybridization protocols
