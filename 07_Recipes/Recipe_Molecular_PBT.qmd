# PBT (PBS + Tween-20) {#sec-recipe-pbt}

## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: Recipe for making 500 ml of PBT (Phosphate Buffered Saline with Tween-20), a versatile wash buffer used in immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization
-   **Procedure Type**: Recipe
-   **Author**: Micah Woods
-   **Date Created**: March 5, 2024

## Solutions

-   10x PBS (50 ml)
    -   Phosphate Buffered Saline, pH 7.4
    -   Purchase pre-made from Chem Stores
-   Nanopure water (450 ml)
    -   Located in the Nalgene at the north sink
-   Tween-20 (1 ml)
    -   Non-ionic detergent
    -   Located in the chemical cabinet on the "Oxidizers A-Z" shelf
    -   Final concentration: 0.2% (v/v)

## Materials

-   500 ml glass Pyrex jar or bottle
-   Pipettes (1 ml and 50 ml)
-   Pipette tips
-   Graduated cylinder

::: {.callout-tip title="Scaling"}
This recipe can be scaled proportionally:
- For 100 ml: 10 ml 10x PBS + 90 ml water + 200 μl Tween-20
- For 250 ml: 25 ml 10x PBS + 225 ml water + 500 μl Tween-20
- For 1 liter: 100 ml 10x PBS + 900 ml water + 2 ml Tween-20
:::

## Procedure

1.  Add 50 ml of 10x PBS to a clean 500 ml glass Pyrex jar

2.  Add 450 ml of nanopure water to the jar
    - Mix gently to dilute PBS

3.  Add 1 ml of Tween-20 to the jar

    ::: {.callout-important title="Note"}
    Tween-20 is a very viscous solution, which can make it challenging to pipet. Push the pipette to the first stop, place the pipette tip in the Tween-20, and wait at least 10 seconds for the Tween-20 to fill the pipette tip. Due to its high viscosity, the Tween-20 will take longer to fill the pipette tip compared to less viscous liquids. Once the pipette tip is full, slowly dispense the Tween-20 into the jar.

4.  Cap jar and mix thoroughly by swirling or gentle inversion
    - Invert 15-20 times to ensure Tween-20 is fully dispersed
    - Solution should be homogeneous

## Storage

-   **Temperature**: Room temperature or 4°C
-   **Duration**: Stable for 2-3 months at room temperature; 3-6 months at 4°C
-   **Container**: 500 ml glass Pyrex jar or bottle with tight-sealing cap
-   **Label**: Mark with "PBT (1x PBS + 0.2% Tween-20)", date prepared, and storage conditions

## Quality Control

-   **pH**: Should be approximately 7.4 (from PBS)
-   **Appearance**: Solution should be clear and colorless
-   **Homogeneity**: Should be well-mixed with no visible Tween-20 droplets or phase separation
-   **Verification**: Mix well before each use as Tween-20 may settle slightly over time

::: {.callout-tip title="Usage Notes"}
- PBT is a general-purpose wash buffer for reducing non-specific binding
- Tween-20 (0.2%) reduces surface tension and helps prevent tissue/sample adhesion
- Used extensively in immunostaining, antibody washes, and in situ hybridization
- Can be used for washing embryos, tissues, and whole-mount specimens
- Compatible with most antibodies and molecular biology applications
- Mix well before each use
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Sterility"}
For cell culture or sterile applications, PBT can be:
- Filter-sterilized through 0.22 μm filter, or
- Prepared using sterile PBS and water, adding Tween-20 aseptically
