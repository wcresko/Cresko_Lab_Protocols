## Introduction

-   **Purpose**: Recipe for diluting 10x TBE and 10x TAE stock solutions to make working concentration electrophoresis buffers for agarose and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
-   **Procedure Type**: Recipe

::: {.callout-note title="Buffer Selection"}
**TBE (Tris-Borate-EDTA)**: Better buffering capacity, preferred for long runs and small DNA fragments. Common for polyacrylamide gels.

**TAE (Tris-Acetate-EDTA)**: Lower buffering capacity but DNA elutes more easily. Preferred for large DNA fragments and DNA recovery from gels. Common for agarose gels.

## Solutions

-   **If making TBE buffer dilution:**
    -   10x TBE stock (Tris-Borate-EDTA)
    -   Located in the cabinet above the microwave
    -   If none is available, obtain 2 liters of pre-made 10x TBE from Chem Stores

-   **If making TAE buffer dilution:**
    -   10x TAE stock (Tris-Acetate-EDTA)
    -   Located in the cabinet above the microwave
    -   If none is available, obtain 2 liters of pre-made 10x TAE from Chem Stores

-   **Nanopure water**
    -   Located in the Nalgene at the sink on the north end of the laboratory
    -   If Nalgene is empty, refill using the Phillips Laboratory nanopure water dispenser located in Pacific 317

## Materials

-   Appropriate vessel for desired final volume:
    -   Small volumes (100-500 ml): graduated cylinder or bottle
    -   Medium volumes (1-5 L): glass bottle or carboy
    -   Large volumes (20 L): 20 liter Nalgene (for 0.5x TBE)
-   Graduated cylinders for measuring stock and water
-   Funnel (for large volume preparations)

::: {.callout-important title="Note"}
If making 0.5x TBE buffer for large-scale gel electrophoresis, use the dedicated 20 liter Nalgene located at the sink at the south end of the laboratory.

## Common Dilutions

**Most common working concentrations:**
- **0.5x** - Standard for most agarose gel electrophoresis
- **1x** - Higher buffering capacity, used for some applications
- **0.25x** - Sometimes used for very large DNA fragments

**Dilution calculations:**
- For 0.5x from 10x: Mix 1 part 10x stock + 19 parts water
- For 1x from 10x: Mix 1 part 10x stock + 9 parts water
- For 0.25x from 10x: Mix 1 part 10x stock + 39 parts water

## Procedure

### Method 1: For 0.5x TBE Buffer (20 L) - Large Scale

1.  Ensure the 20 liter Nalgene is completely empty and clean

2.  Fill the Nalgene with 19 liters of nanopure water
    - The 19 liter mark is marked in Sharpie on the Nalgene

3.  Add 1 liter of 10x TBE stock
    - The 20 liter mark is marked in Sharpie on the Nalgene

4.  Cap and mix thoroughly by inverting or swirling
    - May need to mix several times over 5-10 minutes

### Method 2: For Custom Concentrations and Volumes

1.  **Calculate volumes needed:**
    - Use dilution formula: C₁V₁ = C₂V₂
    - C₁ = initial concentration (10x)
    - V₁ = volume of stock needed
    - C₂ = final concentration (0.5x, 1x, etc.)
    - V₂ = final volume desired

    **Example**: For 1 liter of 0.5x TBE:
    - 10x × V₁ = 0.5x × 1000 ml
    - V₁ = 50 ml of 10x TBE
    - Water needed = 1000 ml - 50 ml = 950 ml

2.  **Prepare buffer:**
    - Add calculated volume of 10x TBE or TAE stock to vessel
    - Add calculated volume of nanopure water
    - Mix thoroughly

3.  **Verify preparation:**
    - Check that final volume matches desired volume
    - Mix well to ensure homogeneous solution

## Storage

-   **Temperature**: Room temperature
-   **Duration**:
    -   TBE: Stable for several months at room temperature
    -   TAE: Stable for 1-2 months; longer storage may lead to precipitation
-   **Container**: Appropriate sized bottle or carboy with tight-sealing cap
-   **Label**: Mark with buffer type (TBE or TAE), concentration (0.5x, 1x, etc.), date prepared

## Quality Control

-   **Appearance**: Both buffers should be clear and colorless
-   **pH**:
    -   TBE: pH approximately 8.3
    -   TAE: pH approximately 8.5
-   **Conductivity**: Can verify dilution using conductivity meter if available
-   **Performance**: Buffer should support good DNA separation without smearing

::: {.callout-caution title="Buffer Reuse"}
**Important**: Do not reuse electrophoresis buffers. Buffer ions become depleted during electrophoresis, reducing buffering capacity. Prepare fresh buffer for each run or set of runs.
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Usage Notes"}
- **For agarose gels**: Either 0.5x TBE or TAE works well; TAE is more common
- **For polyacrylamide gels**: TBE is preferred
- **For DNA recovery**: TAE is preferred (no borate to inhibit downstream enzymes)
- **Gel buffer matching**: Always use same buffer in gel and running tank
- **Temperature**: Allow buffer to equilibrate to room temperature before use
- **Buffer level**: Ensure gel is completely submerged in buffer during electrophoresis
:::

## Troubleshooting

-   **Smearing bands**: Buffer may be exhausted; prepare fresh
-   **Poor resolution**: Verify correct buffer concentration
-   **TAE precipitate**: Prepare fresh; old TAE can precipitate
-   **Unusual migration**: Check pH and buffer concentration
